const REMOTE_HELP = `dev3 remote — run dev-3.0 in headless mode with a browser UI.

Usage:
  dev3 remote [start] [--no-detach] [--no-tunnel] [--expose-ports=<ports>] [--port <n>] [--views-dir <path>]
  dev3 remote status
  dev3 remote url
  dev3 remote restart [<start flags>]
  dev3 remote logs [--follow] [--lines <n>]
  dev3 remote stop
  dev3 remote install-service [--port <n>] [--no-tunnel] [--no-start]
  dev3 remote uninstall-service

  (default subcommand is "start"; bare "dev3 remote" starts the server in the
   BACKGROUND and returns to your shell — add --no-detach to keep it foreground)

What it does:
  Starts a Bun-only dev-3.0 server (no GUI window) and serves the full web UI
  to any browser over HTTP + WebSocket. Prints an ASCII QR code and an access
  URL signed with a short-lived (65s, single-use) JWT token — the QR is
  auto-refreshed every 60 seconds, matching the GUI modal's behavior.

  By default a Cloudflare quick tunnel (trycloudflare.com) is started and its
  public URL is included in the QR, so you can connect from any device without
  setting up SSH port-forwarding. \`cloudflared\` is installed as a brew
  dependency. A custom tunnel command (Settings → System → Tunnel provider)
  replaces the quick tunnel for every tunnel dev3 starts, this one included.
  Pass --no-tunnel for local-only mode (LAN + SSH forward only).

Subcommands:
  start (default)     Start the headless server in the BACKGROUND (survives the
                      current shell), wait until the Cloudflare tunnel is actually
                      reachable (so the link resolves the instant you click it),
                      print the public access link, and return. Add --no-detach
                      to keep it in the foreground instead.
  status              Show whether a server is running, its PID, port, and uptime.
  url                 Print a fresh access URL + QR for the running server. Handy
                      from a new SSH session to re-scan without rerunning start.
  restart             Stop the running background server, then start a fresh one.
                      Pass any start flags (--port, --no-tunnel, …) for the new server.
  logs                Tail the background server's log (~/.dev3.0/remote/remote.log).
                      Add --follow to stream live, --lines <n> to choose how many to show.
                      (Under systemd: \`journalctl --user -u dev3-remote.service -f\`.)
  stop                Stop the background server (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL fallback).
  install-service     (Linux) Install + enable a systemd --user unit so the
                      server survives logout and starts on boot. Accepts the
                      same start flags (e.g. --port, --no-tunnel). The unit runs
                      in the foreground under systemd — do NOT pass --detach.
  uninstall-service   (Linux) Stop, disable, and remove the systemd --user unit.

Flags (start):
  --no-detach
      Keep the server in the FOREGROUND (don't background it). The live banner +
      QR stay on screen and Ctrl-C stops it. Required when a supervisor owns the
      process — systemd (Type=simple), a Docker CMD, etc. The default (no flag)
      backgrounds the server, redirects stdout/stderr to ${REMOTE_LOG_FILE},
      and returns to your shell — then use \`dev3 remote url\` for the link and
      \`dev3 remote stop\` to shut it down. (\`--detach\` is accepted too, but it
      is already the default.)

  --no-tunnel
      Skip the Cloudflare quick tunnel — only LAN + SSH-forward URLs are
      shown. Use this when the machine is already on a trusted network and
      you don't want to expose anything to the public internet, or when
      \`cloudflared\` is unavailable.

  --expose-ports=<csv>
      Comma-separated list of dev-server ports to expose at startup through
      the configured tunnel provider (Cloudflare quick tunnels by default, one
      tunnel per port with its own URL). Retries every 2 s for 60 s until the port
      is actually listening. Useful for headless boxes where you can't click
      the GUI \`Expose\` button.
      Example: --expose-ports=3000,5173

  --port <n>
      Bind to a fixed TCP port instead of a random one. Useful when running
      inside Docker (so you can publish \`-p <n>:<n>\`) or when you want to
      preconfigure an SSH \`-L\` forward without scraping the banner line.
      Valid range: 1-65535. Defaults to a random free port.

  --views-dir <path>
      Override the directory served as static assets (defaults to the
      dist/ next to the binary, or the current working directory's ./dist).

  --static-code=<value>
      Use a fixed access code instead of a rotating short-lived JWT.
      The QR/URL token will be exactly <value>; auto-refresh is disabled.
      For local dev only — do NOT expose a static code on the public
      internet. Minimum length: 4 characters.

Connection options shown on startup:
  ① Public tunnel URL (Cloudflare quick tunnel, unless --no-tunnel)
  ② LAN — scan the QR from any device on the same network
  ③ SSH port-forward — \`ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> user@<server>\`

  Tunnel is the easiest to use from anywhere. SSH is the most private — no
  public exposure, uses your existing SSH credentials, browser points at
  http://localhost.

Examples:
  dev3 remote                              # background + tunnel + LAN + SSH forwarding (returns to shell)
  dev3 remote --no-detach                  # stay in the foreground (watch the QR, Ctrl-C to stop)
  dev3 remote url                          # print a fresh QR/URL for the running server
  dev3 remote restart --port 3000          # restart the background server on a fixed port
  dev3 remote logs --follow                # follow the background server log live
  dev3 remote stop                         # shut the background server down
  dev3 remote install-service --port 3017  # (Linux) run as a systemd --user service
  dev3 remote uninstall-service            # (Linux) remove the systemd --user service
  dev3 remote --no-tunnel                  # LAN + SSH only (no public URL)
  dev3 remote --port 3000                  # fixed port (ideal for Docker -p 3000:3000)
  dev3 remote --expose-ports=3000,5173     # also expose dev-server ports publicly

 *
 *   • Dev (bun run)    argv = [bunPath, "<abs>/main.ts", "remote", …]
 *     `execPath` is `bun`, which needs the entry script as its first arg, so we
 *     prepend argv[1] (the script path) ahead of the user args.
