const UPDATE_HELP = `dev3 update — install a newer dev3 on this machine.

Usage:
  dev3 update
  dev3 update --check
  dev3 update --dry-run

What it does:
  Works out how this dev3 was installed — Homebrew formula, Homebrew cask, or a
  plain CLI tarball — and does the right thing for it: \`brew upgrade\`,
  \`brew upgrade --cask\`, or download-and-swap. Nothing else needs configuring.

  If a headless server is running (\`dev3 remote\`), the update is handed to THAT
  process rather than done here, because only it can pass its port and its live
  Cloudflare tunnel to the replacement — which is what keeps the public link and
  your browser session working across the restart. Running agents survive: their
  tmux sessions are detached and task lifecycles are rehydrated on boot.

  With no server running, the files are simply replaced and nothing restarts.

Flags:
  --check     Say whether an update exists and stop. Changes nothing.
  --dry-run   Print the detected install method and exactly what would run,
              then stop. Use this when an update did something surprising —
              a wrong detection shows up here instead of in a post-mortem.

  Both flags ask the running server when there is one, so what they print is the
  plan that would actually be carried out — not this CLI's view of its own path.

Exit codes:
  0   Up to date, or the update was installed / started.
  ${CLI_EXIT_CODE_UPDATE_REFUSED}   Refused, nothing was touched: this install cannot be updated from the CLI
      (running from source, a copy dev3 keeps inside ~/.dev3.0 rather than an
      install, a macOS app bundle the CLI does not own, Windows, or a cask whose
      version has drifted from brew's record). The reason is printed.
  1   The update was attempted and failed (download, brew, or the file swap).

Examples:
  dev3 update --check      # is there anything new?
  dev3 update --dry-run    # what would it run, and on which install?
  dev3 update              # do it
