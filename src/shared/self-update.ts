 * cloudflared handoff, the relaunch helper — lives in `src/bun/self-update.ts`.
 *
 * THE DESKTOP UPDATER IS A DIFFERENT MECHANISM AND STAYS ONE. Electrobun's

 *  - `remote/rollback/dev3` — the copy a brew self-update takes aside, and the binary
 *    a rolled-back server is actually RUNNING FROM.
 *
 * `realpathSync` resolves both to themselves, so without this they fall through to
 * "tarball" — which would extract a release tree into the frozen `~/.dev3.0/` layout,

 *     which knowingly writes into the Cellar behind brew's back. Serving them a
 *     stable build instead would silently move them off the channel they chose.
 *  3. **The cask is only touched when brew's record matches reality.** The GUI
 *     updater bumps the bundle itself, so most cask installs drift ahead of the
 *     version brew recorded (that is exactly why the cask sets `auto_updates`).
 *     Upgrading in that state can rip the bundle out from under a running server
