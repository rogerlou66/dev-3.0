/**
 * Agent adapter registry, keyed by the base command's last path segment
 * (reusing the llm-provider registry's key-by-command approach). An unknown /
 * custom command resolves to the explicit GenericAdapter, so every call site
 * always holds an adapter — no nullable-adapter guards.
 *
 * A guess by file name is only ever a default. An agent that declares its
 * `AgentFamily` overrides it, because a wrapper script, a shell alias or a
 * renamed build of Claude Code is Claude Code and must run through the very
 * same adapter.
