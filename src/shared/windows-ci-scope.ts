/**
 * Single source of truth for whether a change puts the packaged Windows proof in scope.
 *
 * The list used to live in `windows-conpty-package.yml` as an `on.pull_request.paths`
 * filter. It moved here so a gate could read it, back when the required `test` context
 * waited on that workflow. It no longer does: the proof runs POST-MERGE on `main` and
 * this list decides which pushes dispatch it.
 *
 * The list is still what stands between a Windows regression and nobody noticing, but
 * its failure mode is back to the mild one: a missing entry means "Windows was not
 * proved on this merge", not a required context asserting Windows was checked. See
 * decisions/2026/08/06/windows-proof-post-merge-not-pull-request.md.

/**
 * Changed files matching any of these dispatch the packaged Windows workflow.
 *
 * THIS LIST IS A UNION OF TWO INVARIANTS, not one, and every entry is tagged with the
 * one that earned it:
 *   (1) SHIPS INTO / IS EXERCISED BY the packaged Windows proof — change it and the
 *       packaged Windows app itself may differ.
 *   (2) CARRIES THE BUN PIN that every workflow must hold in lockstep — drift there means
 *       the repo's pins no longer agree, so the packaged proof stops being evidence about
 *       the runtime anyone actually ships. This is why `electrobun.config.ts` and
 *       `package.json` are here even though neither builds Windows.
 *
 * An entry may only be deleted by defeating the SPECIFIC reason that earned it. Deleting
 * one because the other reason does not apply is how coverage silently disappears.
