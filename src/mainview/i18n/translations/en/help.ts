	"help.settings.keyboard.body":
		"Every app-level shortcut in one place. Click the keys shown on a row and type the combo you want; if another shortcut already owns it, you are told whose it is before you take it. Each shortcut also has an optional second combo. A few stay fixed — key sequences like `g d`, the ⌘1–9 project family, the hold-to-cycle task switcher and Esc — and each says why.",
	"help.settings.terminal.title": "Terminal",

	"help.settings.pxpipe.body":
		"An experimental local proxy (pxpipe) that renders bulky context as images to cut input tokens — often ~2× cheaper, a little slower. Off by default; enabling it unlocks the \"Fable 5 (cost trick)\" preset.",
	"help.settings.advancedExperience.title": "Advanced Experience",
	"help.settings.advancedExperience.body":
		"Beta behaviour that earns its keep but is not finished, so it ships off and you opt in per feature. Right-to-left reordering is the first one: terminal panes paint Hebrew and Arabic in reading order instead of reversed. It is a display-only layer on top of a terminal engine that has no right-to-left support of its own yet, so mouse selection and link hover on those lines still follow the underlying order.",

		"Edit everything about the task: title, description (the agent's prompt), labels, priority, and status. Changes apply across the whole variant group. The terminal backend row overrides tmux/native for this task's next launch, and is locked while its terminal is live.",

The bar along the bottom is tmux: each numbered entry is a window, and the one on the right is this task's session name. The agent keeps running when you leave this screen or close the app; it is the session that owns it, not the window you are looking at. Select text to copy it — no ⌘C needed.",
