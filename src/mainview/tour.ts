/**
 * Guided tours — the "hold my hand once" surface, and the counterpart of help
 * mode rather than a second copy of it.
 *
 * Help mode answers "what am I looking at": you ask, it explains a zone, it
 * explains nothing about order. A newcomer on an empty board has the other
 * question — "what do I press, and why" — and no amount of per-zone copy answers
 * it, because the answer is a sequence across four surfaces (board → Create Task
 * → Launch → task screen).
 *
 * Shape of the mechanism, and the three rules that keep it reusable:
 *
 * 1. **A step owns the screen.** Everything except the step's own control is
 *    click-shielded, so the only way on is the way the step describes. The first
 *    build only pointed, and it died on its first live run: the user pressed the
 *    tour's Next while the app stood still, the step's anchor never appeared, and
 *    the tour quietly quit.
 * 2. **The step's button presses the real control** (`action: "click-anchor"`),
 *    it never fakes progress. A step waiting on a choice only the user can make
 *    has no button at all — it says so and waits.
 * 3. **Progress is observed, not reported.** A step advances when the DOM shows
 *    the next anchor, so no component has to call into the tour. Participating
 *    costs one `data-tour-anchor="<id>"` attribute.
 *
 * 4. **The tour follows the app; it never rewinds it.** A step that pressed a
 *    real control cannot be undone — the task exists, the modal has closed — so
 *    there is no Back onto it, and a lost step re-finds its place at the furthest
 *    step whose anchor is on screen rather than jumping to the beginning. Live QA
 *    found both halves of this: Back from Launch pointed at a Save & Start button
 *    that no longer existed, and Start over then opened New Task on top of the
 *    still-open Launch dialog.
 *
 * 5. **Waiting is declared, and the end is an anchor going away.** A step may say
 *    its anchor arrives later (`waitsForAnchor`) — the report an agent publishes
 *    takes as long as the work does — and then its absence is the step, not a
 *    loss. The last step's anchor disappearing finishes the tour: the merge
 *    dialog closing IS the ending.
 *
 * Losing sight of an anchor is a state, not an ending: the card says it lost the
 * thread and offers leaving. Leaving is always one click (Skip) or one key
 * (Escape) away, never an accident.
