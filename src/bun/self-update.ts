/**
 * Self-update for a headless `dev3 remote` box: the I/O half.
 *
 * Every DECISION is in `src/shared/self-update.ts` (pure, table-tested). This
 * file only does what a decision asks for: ask brew what it knows, stage a
 * download, swap the files, hand the live tunnel and the port to the successor,
 * and leave a supervisor behind that can undo it.
 *
 * THE SLOW WORK HAPPENS WHILE THE OLD SERVER IS STILL SERVING. Staging (brew
 * fetch, or download + extract) runs with the browser still connected; the apply
 * step is only the fast part — link or rename, then exit. That is what keeps the
 * unreachable window at a few seconds instead of minutes.

 * Who brings the server back after it exits, and it is NOT one answer.

 *  - `supervisor-exit`: something already owns this process and is PROVEN to —
 *    a systemd unit (`INVOCATION_ID`) or a container runtime. Apply, then exit
 *    NON-ZERO so `Restart=on-failure` (or the orchestrator) relaunches us. No
 *    helper: under systemd's default `KillMode=control-group`, every process left
 *    in the unit's cgroup is killed when the unit stops, so a helper we spawned
 *    would die exactly when it is needed — and a container's helper dies with the
 *    container. Letting the supervisor do the relaunch also keeps `dev3 remote
 *    stop` authoritative: a clean stop still exits 0 and stays stopped.
 *  - `helper`: the background server started by `dev3 remote` (marked by
 *    `DEV3_REMOTE_LOG_FILE`), and every OTHER non-interactive run. Nothing
 *    supervises those, so a detached helper waits for us to die, starts the new
 *    build, and rolls back if the new build never reports in.
 *  - `none`: an INTERACTIVE `dev3 remote --no-detach` — a human watching a
 *    terminal is not a supervisor. Exiting there leaves the box dark until
 *    somebody notices, which is exactly what this feature exists to prevent, so
 *    the update is installed and the restart is left to the operator.
 *
 * SUPERVISOR-EXIT NEEDS POSITIVE EVIDENCE, and "no TTY" is not evidence.
 * `nohup dev3 remote start --no-detach >log 2>&1 &`, a CI runner, and any launcher
 * that redirects stdout all have no TTY, no `INVOCATION_ID` and nothing that
 * restarts them — exiting 75 there leaves the box permanently unreachable. An
 * unnecessary helper, by contrast, costs one short-lived process.
