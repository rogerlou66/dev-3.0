/**
 * Backend-neutral splitting and ownership of extra task panes (seq 1376, 1394).
 *
 * Two layers live here. {@link splitTaskPane} is the primitive: one new pane in
 * the task's own terminal, on whichever backend that task runs. On top of it sits
 * the auxiliary-pane layer — a pane one ACTION owns while it runs, deduped by
 * purpose.
 *
 * An auxiliary pane is a visible pane in the task's own terminal that one action
 * owns while it runs: the dev-server output, a git operation, a column agent such
 * as the built-in AI Review. Before this module
 * every such pane was a raw `tmux split-window` against `dev3-task-<id>`, so on a
 * native task the split hit a session that does not exist — the git panes threw,
 * and the dev-server pane failed inside a best-effort catch, leaving the dev
 * script running invisibly. See the audit note on task 987a4829.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP IS DERIVED, NOT REMEMBERED. A pane is re-found by the command it was
 * launched with, exactly as the tmux code has always re-found its own panes with
 * `#{pane_start_command}`. Nothing is cached in RAM (which an app restart would
 * lose while the pane lives on) and nothing new is written under `~/.dev3.0/`.
 *
 * The caller supplies what each backend runs, because the two are not always the
 * same program: the tmux dev-server pane runs a re-attach loop into a nested
 * session, while the native pane runs the dev script itself. Everything around
 * that — placement, dedup, focus safety, labels — lives here.
 *
 * The native path NEVER calls tmux, and the tmux path is byte-identical to what
 * it did before.
