/**
 * Agent-pane discovery and prompt delivery for the NATIVE terminal backend —
 * the counterpart of the tmux logic in {@link ./agent-prompt}.
 *
 * Three things make this different from tmux, and they are the whole reason the
 * module exists:
 *
 *  - **Discovery is structural, not heuristic.** The agent always runs in the
 *    coordinator's first pane: `startNativeTaskPanes` launches the agent wrapper
 *    there, and every later split is a plain shell (`nativePaneAction` never
 *    passes a launch spec). `createSplitTree` names that pane deterministically
 *    and `recover()` drops dead panes out of the tree, so "`pane-1` is in the
 *    pane set and alive" IS "the agent is running". No focus tracking, no
 *    command sniffing.
 *  - **A binding is not permission to write.** The host grants the writer lease
 *    to ONE client across all dev3 app processes and silently drops an
 *    observer's input, so ownership is resolved from the host itself
 *    (`resolvePaneOwner`, decision 191) before anything is typed.
 *  - **The delivery travels, not the bytes.** When another app process owns the
 *    lease, the whole delivery is forwarded to it over the socket the CLI
 *    already speaks and performed there exactly once. The forwarding process
 *    never also writes, and the owner-side entry point never forwards again, so
 *    there is no hop loop and no double submit.
 *
 * Never touches tmux, and never falls back to it: an unresolvable or unproven
 * target is an honest "no live agent session".
 *
 * A write here can never be PROVEN: `NativeTaskTerminal.write` is void and the host
 * cannot acknowledge input yet (decision 201). So the best answer this module has is
 * `unconfirmed` — it reports that instead of the optimistic "delivered" it used to.
 * A `dev3 message` answers `held` instead, because nothing has been written at all.
