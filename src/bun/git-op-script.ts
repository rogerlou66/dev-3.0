/**
 * The script a git-operation pane runs: rebase, merge, push.
 *
 * These were three hand-written `#!/bin/bash` blobs inside the RPC handlers, so
 * on Windows the pane was dead — it launched `/bin/bash`, which does not exist
 * there (Seq 1547, sibling of Seq 1544's launch fix).
 *
 * THE PORT IS NOT A TRANSLATION. The bash originals carried decisions as well as
 * commands — the merge script chose between `git checkout`, `git checkout --track
 * -b` and an error with an `if`/`elif`/`else` over two `git rev-parse --verify`
 * calls. Re-spelling that in PowerShell would leave one decision expressed twice
 * in two dialects that can drift. Every decision moved into TypeScript instead
 * (`git.refExists`, tested once on every platform), and what reaches the shell is
 * a LINEAR list of announced commands. The dialect only has to spell "run this
 * argv, capture the code, branch on it".
 *
 * WHY THE PANE STILL RUNS GIT AT ALL, rather than dev3 running it and printing
 * the result: the point of the pane is that the user watches git's own output
 * live — the conflict list, the push progress, the hook output — and is left
 * looking at the real message when it fails.
