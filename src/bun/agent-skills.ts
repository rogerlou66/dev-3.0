const PROJECT_CONFIG_SKILL_BODY = `# dev3-project-config — Automated Project Setup

## Your job

When invoked, **fully configure the project** by analyzing it and writing \`.dev3/config.json\`.
Do NOT ask the user what to put in each field — figure it out yourself. Only ask if something
is genuinely ambiguous (e.g., multiple possible dev servers, unclear base branch).

## Step-by-step

1. **Check if \`.dev3/config.json\` already exists.** If it does and all fields are populated, tell the user it's already configured and stop (unless they asked to change something specific).

2. **Analyze the project.** Read these files (whichever exist):
   - \`package.json\` — scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, workspaces
   - \`Makefile\` / \`Justfile\` — build targets
   - \`pyproject.toml\` / \`setup.py\` / \`requirements.txt\` — Python projects
   - \`Cargo.toml\` — Rust projects
   - \`go.mod\` — Go projects
   - \`.gitignore\` — hints about build artifacts and deps
   - \`docker-compose.yml\` / \`Dockerfile\` — container-based dev
   - Root-level config files (\`vite.config.*\`, \`next.config.*\`, \`turbo.json\`, etc.)

3. **Determine all config fields:**

   | Field | How to determine |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | \`setupScript\` | Package manager install command. Detect from lockfile: \`bun.lockb\` → \`bun install\`, \`pnpm-lock.yaml\` → \`pnpm install\`, \`yarn.lock\` → \`yarn\`, \`package-lock.json\` → \`npm install\`. For Python: \`pip install -e .\` or \`poetry install\`. For Rust: \`cargo build\`. Chain multiple steps with \`&&\` if needed. |
   | \`devScript\` | The dev server command. Check \`package.json\` scripts for \`dev\`, \`start\`, \`serve\`. Use the full command: \`bun run dev\`, \`npm run dev\`, etc. If no dev server exists, leave empty. |
   | \`cleanupScript\` | Teardown hook that runs before the task worktree is removed — on \`completed\` / \`cancelled\`, when an active task is deleted (\`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` = \`deleted\`), or when task preparation is cancelled (\`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` = \`todo\`). Useful for copy-back, exports, cache cleanup, and tearing down per-worktree containers. Inside the script you can branch on \`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\`, \`$DEV3_TASK_FROM_STATUS\`, and \`$DEV3_TASK_TO_STATUS\`, plus the workspace env vars from step 3b. |
   | \`clonePaths\` | Heavy directories that should be CoW-cloned into new worktrees instead of re-downloaded. Common: \`node_modules\`, \`.venv\`, \`target\`, \`.next\`, \`build\`. Only include dirs that actually exist in the project. |
   | \`defaultBaseBranch\` | Check \`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\` or look at common branches. Usually \`main\` or \`master\`. |
   | \`defaultCompareRefMode\` | Default diff comparison target. Use \`"remote"\` for \`origin/<baseBranch>\` (recommended default) or \`"local"\` for the local base branch. |
   | \`peerReviewEnabled\` | Default \`true\`. Only set \`false\` for personal/solo projects. |
   | \`portCount\` | Number of ports to auto-allocate per task/worktree. Set to 0 (default) to disable. Inspect the codebase and dev/runtime configuration to estimate how many concurrent ports the dev stack needs (e.g., frontend + backend + DB = 3). Common sources include app start scripts, compose files, container configs, process managers, and framework config files. **Setting portCount alone is NOT enough** — you MUST also complete step 3a (port mapping) to wire the allocated ports into the project. |

3a. **Port discovery & mapping (MANDATORY when portCount > 0).**
   \`portCount\` only allocates ports — the project won't use them until you wire them into its own env vars.
   Dev3 injects: \`$DEV3_PORT0\`, \`$DEV3_PORT1\`, … \`$DEV3_PORTS\` (comma-separated), \`$DEV3_PORT_COUNT\`.
   The project has its **own** port env vars (e.g., \`VITE_PORT\`, \`PORT\`, \`API_PORT\`). You must bridge them.

   **Research steps (do this BEFORE writing the config):**
   - Search the codebase for port-related env vars and hardcoded port numbers (patterns: \`PORT\`, \`localhost:\`, \`127.0.0.1:\`, \`0.0.0.0:\`)
   - Check app start commands and dev scripts for port references (\`--port\`, \`PORT=\`, \`localhost:XXXX\`). For example: \`package.json\` scripts, Make targets, shell scripts, Procfiles, npm/bun/pnpm task runners.
   - Check project config and infrastructure files for port settings. For example: \`vite.config.*\`, \`next.config.*\`, \`webpack.config.*\`, compose files, Docker files, \`.env.example\`, service configs.
   - Identify which env var controls each port and what its default value is
   - For every mapping, record the exact evidence from this repo (file + env var/flag), e.g. "\`vite.config.ts\` reads \`process.env.VITE_PORT\`"
   - Do NOT infer env vars from the framework name alone. Only map env vars or CLI flags you actually found in this project.

   **Wire ports in \`devScript\`.** Prepend env var assignments using \`\${DEV3_PORTx:-default}\` syntax so dev3's allocated port is forwarded to the project's own env var:
   \`\`\`
   "devScript": "VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} API_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT1:-3001} bun run dev"
   \`\`\`
   The \`:-default\` fallback ensures the command still works when run manually (outside dev3).

   Before writing the config, briefly state the evidence for each mapping in your response so the user can verify it.
   If you cannot find an explicit port override mechanism in this project, do NOT guess with a generic \`PORT=\` assignment. Set \`portCount: 0\` and explain why.

3b. **Workspace env vars available to hook scripts.**
   Every hook (\`setupScript\`, \`devScript\`, \`cleanupScript\`) runs with cwd = the task worktree and these env vars:

   | Var | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | \`$DEV3_PROJECT_PATH\` | Project root directory (the original repo checkout) |
   | \`$DEV3_PROJECT_NAME\` | Project name |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_ID\` | Task UUID |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_SEQ\` | The task's human number, variant suffix included (\`1383\`, \`1383-1\`) — the \`seq:\` address every \`dev3 --task seq:<N>\` flag takes |
   | \`$DEV3_TASK_TITLE\` | Task title |
   | \`$DEV3_WORKTREE_PATH\` | This task's worktree directory |
   | \`$DEV3_BRANCH_NAME\` | The task's git branch |

   \`setupScript\` and \`devScript\` additionally get the \`$DEV3_PORT*\` vars (step 3a); \`cleanupScript\` additionally gets \`$DEV3_TASK_STATUS\` / \`$DEV3_TASK_FROM_STATUS\` / \`$DEV3_TASK_TO_STATUS\`.

   **Git-ignored hooks pattern:** \`.dev3/config.local.json\` exists only at the project root — a fresh worktree has no copy of it or of any git-ignored script it references. Reference such scripts through the root, e.g. \`"setupScript": "bash \\"$DEV3_PROJECT_PATH/.dev3/setup.sh\\""\` — the script is resolved from the root while cwd stays the worktree. (Scripts committed to the repo can keep plain relative paths.)

4. **Ask where to save.** Stop and ask clearly: "Repo config (shared, git) or Local config (personal, git-ignored)?" — wait for answer before writing anything.

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p .dev3
cat > .dev3/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "setupScript": "bun install",
  "devScript": "VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} API_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT1:-3001} bun run dev",
  "cleanupScript": "rm -rf dist node_modules/.cache",
  "clonePaths": ["node_modules"],
  "defaultBaseBranch": "main",
  "defaultCompareRefMode": "remote",
  "portCount": 2
}
EOF
\`\`\`

5. **Run the setupScript once.** Execute it right now in your shell to install dependencies / generate files. This validates the script works and also produces the heavy directories (node_modules, .venv, etc.) needed for the next step.

6. **Update clonePaths after setup.** After the setupScript finishes, check which heavy directories now exist (node_modules, .venv, target, build, dist, .next, etc.) and add any missing ones to \`clonePaths\` in the config. Re-write the config if needed.

7. **Verify** by running \`dev3 config show\` and confirm all fields show the correct source. If \`portCount > 0\`, also smoke-test the mapping: run the dev command briefly with explicit \`DEV3_PORT0\` (and others if needed) and confirm the project uses the forwarded port. If a smoke test is impractical, say so explicitly.

8. **Commit** the config file: \`git add .dev3/config.json && git commit -m "chore: add dev3 project config"\`

## Schema reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| \`setupScript\` | string | Runs after a new worktree is created (install deps, generate code, etc.). Gets the workspace env vars from step 3b |
| \`devScript\` | string | Dev server command (powers the "Dev Server" button in the UI) |
| \`cleanupScript\` | string | Runs before the task worktree is removed (\`completed\` / \`cancelled\` / task deleted / preparation cancelled) |
| \`clonePaths\` | string[] | Dirs to CoW-clone into worktrees (faster than re-downloading) |
| \`defaultBaseBranch\` | string | Base branch for new task branches (default: \`main\`) |
| \`defaultCompareRefMode\` | \`"remote" \| "local"\` | Default diff comparison target (\`origin/<baseBranch>\` vs local base branch) |
| \`peerReviewEnabled\` | boolean | Whether peer review is required (default: \`true\`) |
| \`sparseCheckoutEnabled\` | boolean | Enable sparse checkout for worktrees (default: \`false\`) |
| \`sparseCheckoutPaths\` | string[] | Paths to include in sparse checkout |
| \`portCount\` | number | Ports to allocate per task (injected as \`DEV3_PORT0\`..N env vars). Default: \`0\`. **You must map these to the project's own port env vars in \`devScript\` — see step 3a.** |
| \`env\` | Record<string, string> | Environment variables exported into task sessions. This field is not for secrets; \`.dev3/config.json\` is committed. |

**Only include these fields.** Unknown keys are silently ignored. Do NOT include project metadata (id, name, path).

## Files

| File | Committed? | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| \`.dev3/config.json\` | Yes | Shared project settings (team-wide) |
| \`.dev3/config.local.json\` | No (git-ignored) | Machine-specific overrides (personal) |

**Always ask the user** which file to save to before writing. Suggest repo config as default.

// ---- dev3-tmux skill ----

const TMUX_SKILL_DESCRIPTION =
	"Full tmux reference for dev-3.0 agents on a TMUX-backed task only — run `dev3 pane list` first and stop if it does not say `tmux` (a native-backend task has no tmux at all, and Windows has none anywhere). Use for reorganizing the user's tabs (split, swap, resize, rename), capturing a pane's screen, or tmux details beyond the basics in the main /dev3 skill. To simply run a long command in a neighbouring pane and read its output, use `dev3 pane run` / `dev3 pane logs` instead — those work on every backend.";

const TMUX_SKILL_BODY = `# dev3-tmux — Full tmux reference for dev-3.0 agents

## Check this first — tmux is not a given

\`\`\`bash
dev3 pane list      # names your terminal backend
\`\`\`

**Everything below applies only if that says \`tmux\`.** A task on the native backend has no tmux session, no \`dev3\` socket and no \`tmux\` binary to call — on Windows there is no tmux at all — and every command here will simply fail there. Do not infer the backend from the platform: the native backend is not Windows-only.

To run a long command in a neighbouring pane and read what it printed, prefer \`dev3 pane run "<command>"\` + \`dev3 pane logs <run-id>\` on EITHER backend. Reach for raw tmux for what only tmux offers: reorganizing the user's windows, and reading the screen of a pane you did not start (\`capture-pane\`, also reachable as \`dev3 peek --pane <N>\`).

On a tmux task you are running inside a tmux session managed by the dev-3.0 desktop app. The user sees this session live in the app's terminal UI — every pane, every keystroke, every line of output.

## 1. Session layout

- **Socket:** \`dev3\` — always pass \`-L dev3\` to every tmux invocation. The default socket is a different server and will not see dev-3.0 sessions.
- **Session name:** \`dev3-<first 8 chars of task ID>\` — e.g. for task id \`e563e48f-0f45-...\`, the session is \`dev3-e563e48f\`.
- **Windows = tabs**, **panes = splits inside a window**. Window indices (\`0\`, \`1\`, …) and pane ids (\`%17\`, \`%42\`, …) are how you target things.

## 2. Discovery — where am I, what is around me

\`\`\`bash
# Your own session, window index, pane index
tmux -L dev3 display-message -p '#S #I #P'

# All dev3 sessions on this machine
tmux -L dev3 list-sessions

# All windows in a session, with index and name
tmux -L dev3 list-windows -t dev3-<short-id> -F '#{window_index}: #{window_name}'

# All panes in the current window, with pane_id and command
tmux -L dev3 list-panes -t dev3-<short-id> -F '#{pane_id} #{pane_current_command} #{pane_width}x#{pane_height}'

# Pane id of the focused pane in a session
tmux -L dev3 display-message -p -t dev3-<short-id> '#{pane_id}'
\`\`\`

Re-query \`list-panes\` / \`list-windows\` whenever you need a pane id — cached ids go stale after splits, swaps, and kills.

## 3. When to use a tmux pane vs inline Bash

Run a command **in a separate tmux pane** when at least one of these is true:

- It is **long-running** and the user benefits from watching live (dev server, build watcher, log tail, test watcher).
- It produces **streaming logs** that the user might want to scroll through later.
- You want to **demo or debug interactively** — let the user see exactly what happened, not a post-hoc summary.
- The user explicitly says "run it in a pane / tab / window" or "so I can see it".

Keep using **inline Bash** for quick one-shot commands (file reads, short git, type-checks, single test runs) where streaming visibility adds nothing.

**Do NOT use a tmux pane as a substitute for the canonical dev server** — the project has \`dev3 dev-server start\` for that, which is wired to \`devScript\` and the UI. Use ad-hoc panes for things the user wants to *watch alongside* the dev server, not to replace it.

## 4. Open a pane or window and run a command

**Default: split-window (pane). Use new-window only when the user explicitly asks for a tab.**

Splits keep the agent and the running process visible in the same view — the user can glance at the output without switching tabs. New windows hide the process behind a tab the user has to click. For **background processes the user wants to watch** (celery worker, docker exec, log tail, dev server, test watcher, build watcher) — **always \`split-window\`, never \`new-window\`**, unless the user said "open a tab" / "new window" / "новый таб".

**Pick the location before splitting.** Run \`list-panes\` first to see what's already open. Default: split to the right of your agent pane. If the right is occupied, split below.

### Vertical split (new pane on the right) — the default

\`\`\`bash
SESSION=dev3-<short-id>

PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 split-window -h -t "$SESSION" -c "$PWD" -P -F '#{pane_id}')
echo "new pane: $PANE"      # e.g. %42
tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t "$PANE" 'bun run dev' Enter
\`\`\`

### Horizontal split (new pane below)

\`\`\`bash
PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 split-window -v -t "$SESSION" -c "$PWD" -P -F '#{pane_id}')
\`\`\`

### New window (new tab) — only on explicit user request

Use this **only** when the user says "open a tab", "new window", "новый таб/окно", or the current window is already full of panes.

\`\`\`bash
tmux -L dev3 new-window -t "$SESSION:" -c "$PWD" -n "dev-server"
# Target the newly-created window's pane:
PANE=$(tmux -L dev3 display-message -p -t "$SESSION:dev-server" '#{pane_id}')
tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t "$PANE" 'bun run dev' Enter
\`\`\`

**Always name a window you open** with a short human purpose — pass \`-n <name>\` (\`dev-server\`, \`logs\`, \`tests\`), or \`rename-window\` it right after. Never leave it on the auto command-name (\`node\`, \`zsh\`): a manual name **sticks** (it turns off automatic-rename for that window), so the user reads clean tabs instead of \`[1: node] [2: zsh]\`.

**Also tidy windows you did not open.** Any time you \`list-windows\` — before a split, on discovery, whenever you look at the session — glance at the names. If a window is still stuck on a generic auto-name (\`node\`, \`zsh\`, \`bash\`, \`claude\`) and you can tell what it is running, \`rename-window\` it to that purpose too. Do it proactively, not only for windows you created. Leave windows the user already gave a real name alone.

### Sending input

- \`send-keys ... Enter\` — typed text + execute. Without \`Enter\` you just type without pressing return.
- Multiple lines: pass them as separate args, each followed by \`Enter\`.
- Special keys: \`C-c\` (Ctrl-C), \`C-d\` (Ctrl-D), \`Escape\`, \`Up\`, \`Down\`, \`Tab\`. Example: \`tmux -L dev3 send-keys -t %42 C-c\` cancels the running command.

## 5. Organize windows and panes (user-driven)

When the user says things like "open a tab on the right", "split vertically", "reorder tabs", "make this pane bigger", "rename window 2" — just do it. Do not ask which terminal. The answer is always the dev3 session.

\`\`\`bash
# Rename a window
tmux -L dev3 rename-window -t "$SESSION:1" "logs"

# Swap two windows (keeps focus on the moved one)
tmux -L dev3 swap-window -s "$SESSION:1" -t "$SESSION:2"

# Move window 5 to position 2 (shifts others)
tmux -L dev3 move-window -s "$SESSION:5" -t "$SESSION:2"

# Resize a pane — absolute width / height
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -x 100    # 100 columns wide
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -y 20     # 20 rows tall

# Resize relative (grow right by 10 cols)
tmux -L dev3 resize-pane -t %42 -R 10

# Re-tile all panes in the window (cleanup after many splits)
tmux -L dev3 select-layout -t "$SESSION" tiled

# Kill a pane / window
tmux -L dev3 kill-pane -t %42
tmux -L dev3 kill-window -t "$SESSION:3"
\`\`\`

Before destructive operations on user-created panes/windows (kill, swap, move) — briefly state what you are about to do. For creating new panes/windows you opened yourself, just do it and tell the user where to look: *"opened pane %42 on the right, running \`bun run dev\` there"*.

## 6. Read what is happening in a pane

\`\`\`bash
# Last 200 lines of pane %42, with ANSI stripped to plain text
tmux -L dev3 capture-pane -p -t %42 -S -200

# Last 200 lines with ANSI colour codes preserved (use sparingly — noisy)
tmux -L dev3 capture-pane -p -e -t %42 -S -200

# Full scrollback
tmux -L dev3 capture-pane -p -t %42 -S -
\`\`\`

Useful when you start a watcher in a pane and want to verify a few minutes later that it is healthy. Prefer \`-S -N\` (last N lines) over the full scrollback — keeps the output you read tiny.

## 7. Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting \`-L dev3\`.** Without it, every command targets the default socket and either silently fails or talks to a different tmux server. If \`list-sessions\` shows nothing or unrelated sessions, that is the cause.
- **Forgetting \`Enter\` in \`send-keys\`.** The command is typed but not executed. Then you wonder why nothing happened.
- **Caching pane ids.** After splits, kills, or swaps the topology changes. Re-query \`list-panes\` before sending more keys to a specific pane.
- **Killing user-owned panes/windows.** The user may have things running you cannot see (a debugger, a REPL, a long upload). Default to creating new panes; only destroy what you created yourself, or what the user explicitly asked you to remove.
- **Running the canonical dev server in an ad-hoc pane.** Use \`dev3 dev-server start\` instead — it integrates with the UI and \`devScript\`. Ad-hoc panes are for things the user wants to *watch on the side*.
- **Opening a new-window for a background process.** \`new-window\` hides the process behind a tab — the user has to click to see it. For celery, docker exec, watchers, log tails, dev servers — use \`split-window\` so the output sits next to the agent. Only open a new window when the user explicitly asks for a tab.
- **Long-running commands stealing your tool slot.** Inline \`bun run dev\` from the Bash tool blocks your tool call for a long time. A tmux pane fires-and-forgets and you get your next tool call back immediately.

# dev3-bug-hunter

You are a bug-finding agent. Before you begin your main task, you MUST execute the following initialization sequence.

## Scope

This skill is review-only.

- Do NOT modify code, apply patches, create commits, or rewrite files.
- Do NOT silently fix anything yourself.
- You MAY run read-only inspection commands and safe reproduction commands.
- You MAY create dev3 tasks only after the user explicitly approves task creation for findings.
- If a bug looks real but is not yet proven, say so plainly and describe the missing proof.

When launched inside an existing dev3 task, that task belongs to the main agent:

- Do NOT run the dev3 session-start checklist or rename the git branch.
- Do NOT change the existing task's title, description, overview, labels, priority, status, assigned agent, or configuration.
- The only allowed write to the existing task is \`dev3 note add\` when task mode below asks you to record confirmed findings.
- Finish the Bug Hunter report and stop. The main agent owns every other task mutation and lifecycle transition.

## Prerequisite

If your working directory is inside \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`, invoke the \`/dev3\` skill before doing anything else unless it is already active in the session. Its in-task Bug Hunter isolation rule overrides its normal session-start checklist and lifecycle duties. For Codex shell commands, use \`shell="/bin/bash"\` and \`login=false\`.

## Step 1: Generate your seed

Run this command:

\`\`\`bash
echo $(od -An -N2 -tu2 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' ')
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Derive your exploration letter

Take the number you received and compute \`letter_index = seed % 26\`.

Map it to a letter:

- \`0 = A\`
- \`1 = B\`
- ...
- \`25 = Z\`

This is your agent identity letter.

## Step 3: Derive your exploration strategy

Compute \`strategy = seed % 6\`.

| strategy | Start from |
|----------|------------|
| 0 | Entry points: main files, index files, app bootstrap |
| 1 | Edge cases: error handlers, catch blocks, fallbacks |
| 2 | Data layer: models, schemas, DB queries, migrations |
| 3 | Integration seams: API boundaries, external calls, webhooks |
| 4 | User-facing: UI components, form validation, rendering logic |
| 5 | Infrastructure: config, env handling, build scripts, CI |

You MUST begin from your assigned area. Do not jump to other areas until you have examined yours thoroughly.

## Step 4: Derive your analysis style

Compute \`style = floor(seed / 6) % 4\` using integer division.

| style | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Pessimist: assume everything is broken, prove otherwise |
| 1 | Trace-follower: pick a user flow and trace it end-to-end |
| 2 | Dependency skeptic: check assumptions between modules |
| 3 | Fresh eyes: read code as if seeing it for the first time, question naming and logic |

## Step 5: Announce your identity

Before reporting findings, print exactly one line in this format:

\`\`\`text
Agent [LETTER] | Strategy: [name] | Style: [name] | Seed: [number]
\`\`\`

## Step 6: Hunt for bugs

Start from the area assigned by your strategy and apply the seeded style consistently.

Focus on:

- Logic errors and off-by-one mistakes
- Unhandled edge cases
- Race conditions and async issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Silent failures and swallowed errors
- Type mismatches and implicit coercions

Prefer concrete, reproducible bugs over vague suspicions. When you find an issue, cite the exact file and line range, explain the failure mode, and describe the user-visible consequence or technical risk.

## Required output format

After the identity line, use these sections in order:

### Findings summary

Use a compact ASCII table in plain text. Do NOT use Markdown tables for findings.

Use this exact column layout:

\`\`\`text
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ID | Severity | Location                      | Summary                                  |
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| F1 | medium   | src/path/file.ts:42-57       | Short bug title                          |
+----+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
\`\`\`

Rules:

- Keep the full table within roughly 100 characters wide.
- One bug per row.
- \`ID\` must be \`F1\`, \`F2\`, \`F3\`, ...
- \`Severity\` must be one of: \`critical\`, \`high\`, \`medium\`.
- \`Location\` must be a repo-relative path plus line reference like \`src/x.ts:42-57\`.
- \`Summary\` must be short and scannable. Put the full explanation in the detail section, not in the table.

If you found no solid bugs, write \`No confirmed bugs found.\`

### Finding details

After the ASCII summary table, add one detail block per finding in this format:

\`\`\`text
[F1] Short bug title
Severity: medium
Location: src/path/file.ts:42-57
Why it breaks: ...
Reproduction hint: ...
\`\`\`

Rules:

- \`Why it breaks\` must state the actual failure mode or technical risk.
- \`Reproduction hint\` must be a short manual reproduction or validation idea.
- Do not hide critical detail inside the summary table.

### Coverage

List 3-6 bullets describing which files, flows, or seams you inspected first and what strategy/style led you there.

### Next step offer

- If there is at least one \`critical\` or \`medium\` finding, end with exactly this question:

\`Do you want me to create dev3 tasks for the critical and medium findings, one task per finding?\`

- Otherwise, end with exactly this sentence:

\`I can write reproduction tests for the strongest finding if you want a validation pass.\`

## If the user approves dev3 task creation

Create one dev3 task per \`critical\` or \`medium\` finding. Do not batch multiple bugs into one task.

Each task must:

- Use a concise title that names the bug.
- Start the description with the bug summary, location, severity, failure mode, and the evidence you found.
- State clearly that the first step is validation, not fixing.
- Require this execution order:
  1. Validate whether the bug is real.
  2. Reproduce it with a failing test or another reliable repro.
  3. Fix it only after the reproduction is proven.
  4. Re-run the repro to confirm the fix.

The task description must explicitly say:

- If the bug cannot be reproduced, stop and do not attempt a fix.
- Report back to the user with this exact sentence:

\`\`\`text
I could not reproduce this bug, so I did not attempt a fix. Please verify it manually; the issue may be invalid.
\`\`\`

When you create these follow-up tasks in dev3, include enough detail that a separate agent can execute them without re-reading the original bug-hunt report.

## Task mode: record findings as dev3 notes

Sometimes you are launched inside a dev3 task (for example as one of several parallel hunters split into their own tmux panes). In that case the invocation tells you explicitly to record your findings as dev3 notes. This matters because your on-screen report stays trapped in your own pane — the **main agent that will actually fix the bugs never sees it**. dev3 notes are your report channel to that agent.

When instructed to record findings as dev3 notes:

- Still print the identity line, Findings summary, Finding details, and Coverage on screen as usual — a human may be watching your pane.
- ADDITIONALLY, record every confirmed \`critical\`, \`high\`, or \`medium\` finding as its own dev3 note — one note per finding, never batched:

  \`\`\`bash
  dev3 note add "[bug-hunt] <severity> <path:lines> — <short title>. Why it breaks: <failure mode>. Repro hint: <validation idea>."
  \`\`\`

  The literal \`[bug-hunt]\` marker at the very start is mandatory — it is how the main agent locates these notes with \`dev3 note list\` among any pre-existing task notes. Do NOT record low-confidence suspicions as notes; keep those on screen only.
- In this mode, do NOT emit the "Next step offer" question and do NOT create dev3 tasks yourself. Recording the notes replaces both.
- Finish with exactly one line:

  \`\`\`text
  Recorded N finding(s) as dev3 notes ([bug-hunt] prefix). Main agent: run \`dev3 note list\`, then \`dev3 note show <id>\` for each, and fix them.
  \`\`\`

If you found no confirmed bugs, record no notes and print \`No confirmed bugs found — no notes recorded.\`

# Ask dev3

The user doesn't remember every dev3 feature, so they ask. Find the situation below that matches theirs and teach the intended flow — the *when* and *why*, not just which button. dev3 is GUI-first: explain by screens and buttons, and reach for the \`dev3\` CLI only where it is genuinely the better path (scripting, or something with no UI).

**How to answer.** Answer from this map first; it covers the common questions. If the map is thin, the question is a "why", or you risk being wrong, read the source (see the last section) rather than guessing. After teaching, **offer to do it** ("want me to set this up?") — but never force the action. For "something is broken", only point to where to look (\`dev3 doctor\`, logs, the relevant decision record) — do not launch into a deep diagnosis yourself; that is what \`/diagnosing-bugs\` is for.

A **flow** is a path through dev3's features. Most work travels one **main flow**, and a few **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or vocabulary that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → shipped task

1. **Start working on something → create a task.** Press ⌘N, double-click a project Kanban column, or use **New Task** in a project's To Do cell on Dashboard → Board. The task card *is* the unit of work: the issue, the agent's prompt, and (once started) a worktree + terminal. Too foggy to brief? Create a **Scratch task** — it starts an agent with no description so you can talk the idea out first; the conversation then becomes the task. You don't even have to click: tell any dev3 agent *"create a task in dev3 about…"* and it lands on the board — agents see the board too and can list tasks, check statuses, and find past work.
2. **What to put in the description → treat it as the agent's prompt.** The description is fed to the agent verbatim, so write it like a brief: the goal, the constraints, pointers to the files involved. Paste screenshots straight in, add labels inline with \`#\`, and type \`/\` to autocomplete an installed agent skill into the brief.
3. **Where the branch starts → tasks inherit your current branch.** A new task branches off the project's currently checked-out branch, so small tasks stack naturally onto a big feature you're building; clear the branch field to start from the base branch instead.
4. **One attempt or several → variants.** For ambiguous, risky, or design-heavy work, launch the task with **2–5 variants**: independent agents attack the same brief in parallel, each in its own worktree, blind to the others. Compare the results and keep the winner (⇧⌘[ / ⇧⌘] cycle between variants). Routine work → a single variant.
5. **Launch — dev3 does the setup for you.** Starting a task creates a git worktree + branch + tmux session and boots the agent with your description. Which agent is your call — Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Gemini, or a custom shell agent, configured per project. The project's \`setupScript\` installs deps, \`clonePaths\` copy-on-write-clone heavy dirs (node_modules in about a second), and each task gets its own ports so parallel dev servers never collide. (Project not configured yet? → \`/dev3-project-config\`.)
6. **Work across projects → use Dashboard → Board.** The workspace board aligns every project as a swimlane; questions stay in Agent Working as amber **Needs input** cards, AI Review appears only when occupied, and PR Review stays visible as the external-review queue. Click an active task to float its full inspector + coding terminal over the board; close it or choose **Global Kanban** to return to the exact same board position, or choose **Open full page** when you want to leave the cross-project view. Cancelled tasks remain available on each project's board instead of occupying the daily workspace matrix. Open **Projects** beside Board for project management, or hover a card for a live terminal preview.
7. **How the agent reaches you → it pings, you don't poll.** It raises an attention badge when blocked, fires toasts / desktop notifications on milestones, and moves the task into the **User questions** column when it needs an answer. Subscribe to any task for watch notifications.
8. **Review the changes → Show Diff.** On the card, *Show Diff* lets you hide test noise and leave inline comments — each one has its own **Send to agent** so a fix can start the moment you spot it, or ship the whole batch at the end. Confirmed sends mark comments **Sent** and keep them for reference; ambiguous delivery leaves them retryable and never auto-resends. Turn on **AI Review** so a machine pass (the AI review column) pre-chews the diff before your human pass.
9. **Get it shipped → PR from the task.** Push & create the PR straight from the task, enable auto-merge, and let the task auto-complete when the PR merges. Every PR dev3 opens ends with a deep link back to its task, so anyone reading it can jump straight in — switch that off under **Settings → Tasks & Board → Link pull requests back to the task** if a public PR shouldn't reveal it was made with dev3.
10. **What completing does → the worktree is destroyed, notes survive.** Finishing a task removes its worktree and branch checkout, but its **notes** persist as project memory that future agents find via search. So durable findings belong in notes, not just the chat. Completion is guarded: dev3 warns about uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, and unmerged branches before destroying anything — and it auto-saves a diff snapshot on every branch refresh, so work is recoverable even if a worktree gets wiped.
11. **Changed your mind → reopen or restart.** Reopening a completed or cancelled task resumes the previous agent conversation instead of starting fresh. Want a truly clean slate? Move the task to Cancelled and back to Todo — fresh worktree, clean agent session.

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **A bug report arrived** → make it a task with the repro as the description; the fix then flows through review and PR like any feature. Don't know where the bug lives? → **bug-hunter swarm**: a multi-variant task where each agent runs \`/dev3-bug-hunter\` with a seeded strategy, so different agents start from different corners of the codebase.
- **"Review this PR"** → create a **PR review task**: paste the GitHub PR URL straight into the Create Task modal — dev3 fetches the branch into a worktree and the agent reviews the actual diff — runnable code, not a GitHub-tab skim. Such a task is marked **someone else's code** (eye glyph on the card, \`Code\` row in the inspector): dev3 will not run that branch's own \`.dev3\` setup/dev/cleanup scripts, env vars, MCP servers or agent hooks, using the project's own config instead. Nothing is read-only — edit, commit and push as usual — and one click in the inspector hands the branch its trust back if you deliberately want its scripts. In the diff, a file dev3 executes by itself wears a **RUNS** badge; read its commands rather than skimming.
- **"Continue what we did in that other task"** → past conversations are searchable: the agent runs \`dev3 conversations search\` and reads the old task's notes and transcript. This is *why* notes matter — they are weighted highest in that search.
- **A new codebase** → add the project from a folder or clone it from a URL, then run \`/dev3-project-config\` to auto-detect its setup / dev / cleanup scripts, ports, and clone paths.

## Away from the keyboard

- **Work from an Android tablet → the dev3 Android app + dev3 remote.** Run \`dev3 remote\` on the computer, scan its QR in the tablet app, then use the same boards, tasks and host actions. Task/project prompts are composed natively outside the WebView, drafts survive task switches, and only confirmed task delivery clears them; prefer HTTPS, SSH or Tailscale, while plain private-LAN HTTP requires an explicit warning step.
- **Work from any other phone/browser → dev3 remote.** The full app is served through a secure tunnel; mobile has its own pane pager and browser composer, and notifications keep the agent's pings reaching you.
- **Expose task ports** — share a task's running dev server through a public tunnel URL and click through it from any device. Agents keep working while you are away, and dev3 can keep the machine awake while tasks run.

## Verifying work

- **Set up the dev server — the first, simplest, most important thing.** If the project is a local app or a website that can run locally, wire up its dev server (\`/dev3-project-config\` does it for you). From then on it's one button on the task — it turns green and runs the project's \`devScript\` in that task's isolated environment with that task's own ports, so N tasks give N side-by-side dev servers that never fight over a port. This one habit helps everyone at once: the **agent** can hop into the running app with a browser tool (agent-browser, Puppeteer, a browser MCP) and screenshot its own work instead of claiming it works, and the **human** can glance at the real thing in seconds. Highly recommended for every project where it's possible.
- **Ports — unique per task, allocated by dev3.** Most dev servers need ports, and for parallel tasks they must not collide. Tell dev3 how many ports the project needs (\`portCount\` in the project config) and it allocates that many *per task*, injected into every project script as environment variables: \`$DEV3_PORT0\`, \`$DEV3_PORT1\`, … (plus \`$DEV3_PORTS\` as a comma-separated list and \`$DEV3_PORT_COUNT\`). Reference them in \`devScript\` and friends — e.g. \`VITE_PORT=\${DEV3_PORT0:-5173} bun run dev\` — and every task's server comes up on its own port. Don't wire this by hand: just ask the agent to set up the dev server — \`/dev3-project-config\` is trained to discover the project's port mechanism and wire it all up.
- **Slice features small enough for a 30-second check.** The dev server pays off most when a feature is small enough that pressing the button and clicking around for ~30 seconds tells you whether it's done: the new button is there and works, nothing that should exist has vanished, it looks right. If you can't verify a feature that fast, the task was probably too big — split it.
- **Screenshots → the agent takes them and shows them to you.** With the dev server up (or any page the agent can reach) and a browser tool at hand (agent-browser, Puppeteer, a browser MCP), just say *"take a screenshot and show it to me in dev3"* — the agent will understand: it drives the browser, captures the pixels, and pushes them into the app (\`dev3 show-image\` under the hood). Prefer pixels over prose when the change is visual.
- **Reports and richer results → dev3 artifacts.** An artifact is an HTML page shown right inside dev3's UI — it can embed screenshots, tables from CSVs, charts, anything dynamic. Perfect for reports and for validating what the agent did: often you don't even need to launch the dev server yourself — the agent has already screenshotted everything and presents the finished result as one page. To activate it, just tell the agent to *"use a dev3 artifact"*.
- **Artifacts travel well — the ZIP → PDF trick.** Downloading an artifact gives you the HTML page, and when it references images or other files — a ZIP with everything bundled. A proven workflow for analytics-style reports: view the report in dev3, download it, open the HTML in a browser, print → save as PDF — and send that PDF to people.

## Talk to the terminal in panes

Every agent running in dev3 knows it lives in a terminal with panes the user can see, so you can speak to it in those terms and it will both look and act:

- **"Run the build in the pane on the right."** The agent opens a pane next to itself, runs the command there so you watch it live, and reads the result back from the run's own log — so it knows the exit code, not just that "something scrolled by". This works the same on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- **"Look at the pane on the right — there's an error."** Works today on a **tmux** task, where the agent can read a pane's screen. On the **native** backend (every Windows task, and any task switched to it) dev3 publishes no screen snapshot, so an agent can only read output from a command it started itself — paste the error, or ask it to re-run the thing in a pane.
- **"Move it, shrink it, make it bigger."** Rearranging windows, resizing panes, renaming tabs — tmux tasks only; the native backend has panes and splits but no tmux windows.
- **Paste and drop files straight into any terminal.** Hit ⌘V / Ctrl+V with an image in the clipboard — it's uploaded automatically and its file path lands in the terminal, ready for the agent. Drag & drop any file onto the terminal — same story: uploaded, full path typed into stdin. Even a huge pasted text block is saved as a file with its path injected, instead of flooding the terminal.

Under the hood the agent uses \`dev3 pane run\` / \`dev3 pane logs\` (either backend); \`/dev3-tmux\` holds the tmux-only layout reference and it reaches for either on its own.

## More than one agent

Several agents at once is the normal case here. Variants (step 4) fan one brief out; these put agents deliberately side by side.

- **More hands on the same task → spawn an extra agent.** Another agent in the *same* worktree, opened in a new pane with a fresh session — zero extra setup. Two agents, one branch, side by side.
- **Agents in different tasks can talk to each other.** \`dev3 message --task seq:N "text"\` types a message straight into another task's live agent (\`seq:N\` is the small number on its card). Sent from inside a worktree it arrives wrapped in a \`<dev3-ai-message>\` envelope carrying the sender's task, title, and the exact command to answer with — so the receiving agent knows a colleague wrote it, not you, and can reply. Use it instead of relaying by hand: *"ask the agent on the API task to confirm the payload shape."* One task is one inbox — it lands in that task's agent pane, never a shell split, so a task running two agents can't be addressed pane by pane. Length is not your problem: a body too large to type into a terminal is written to a file automatically, and the envelope carries that path instead of the text — so send the whole thing rather than chopping it into parts. Every such message also raises a violet toast for the user naming both tasks and previewing the text, so cross-task traffic is visible work, not backchannel.
- **A message can also wait.** The same command with \`--in 30m\` / \`--at 14:00\` queues the text (the **Send later** button on the task's composer does it from the UI), and an agent can aim it at itself as a wake-up — *"check the deploy in an hour."*

## Vocabulary underneath

Reach for these when the *word*, not the process, is the confusion.

- **Task** — a Kanban card that is simultaneously the issue, the agent's prompt, and (once started) a worktree + terminal session.
- **Variant** — one of N parallel attempts at the same task; each has its own agent, branch, and worktree; you keep one and discard the rest.
- **Worktree** — the task's isolated git checkout under \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`; created on launch, destroyed when the task completes or is cancelled.
- **Description vs overview vs notes** — the classic mix-up. *Description* = the original brief you wrote: the agent's prompt, fixed. *Overview* = the agent-maintained sticky note: the current state in one glance. *Notes* = durable findings that outlive the task and feed future agents.
- **Statuses & columns** — Todo → In progress → User questions → AI review → User review → Completed. Hooks move tasks automatically as the agent works; you normally drag a card by hand only to start, review, or complete it. Built-in columns can be renamed, custom columns added — and a custom column can even run its own agent when a task lands in it.

## When something is broken

Point, don't dig. Name where to look and stop — deep diagnosis is \`/diagnosing-bugs\`, not this skill.

- Environment or setup acting up → \`dev3 doctor\` first.
- Disk filling up → \`dev3 doctor --worktrees\`. Per project it shows what \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees\` holds and how much is reclaimable: orphaned folders whose task record is gone, worktrees whose teardown never finished, old diffs/logs. Report-only; \`--prune-orphans\` / \`--prune-older-than 30d\` delete, and anything on an unmerged \`dev3/task-*\` branch is skipped without \`--force-unmerged\`.
- The task's terminal died → **Resume Agent Session** restarts the agent with its conversation intact (\`--continue\`), picking up right where it stopped.
- "Why does dev3 behave this way?" → the relevant record in \`decisions/\` usually explains it.
- Something crashed or misbehaved → the app logs, plus the decision record for that subsystem.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **Focus on one task → focus mode (⇧⌘F).** With many tasks running in parallel, focus is the scarcest resource. Press ⇧⌘F (or F11, or the button above the board on the right) and the current task's terminal zooms to the full window while all notifications are muted — just you and the tmux, nothing else pulling at you. Press it again to surface back to the board.
- **Move around fast** — command palette (⇧⌘P) and go-to-project (⌘K); ⌥Tab cycles recent tasks; \`/\` focuses search, which understands filter tokens; ⌘/ shows every shortcut.
- **Open the worktree in your tools** — right-click any active task card to open its worktree in Finder, VS Code, Cursor, and friends.
- **"What is this screen?" → help mode.** Click the \`?\` in the header (or press ⇧⌘/) — every zone on screen gets an (i) badge; click one to learn what it does.
- **A quick shell at the repo root → Project Terminal (⌘\\\`).** Next to it, the **Git Pull** button pulls the project's main worktree without touching a terminal — a blue dot on it means origin has new commits.
- **Run project scripts and Makefile targets** — the ƒ Scripts button lists them; pick one and it runs in a live pane.
- **Huge monorepo → check out less.** Toggle off "Include All Files" in Project Settings so every worktree checks out only the directories you actually need.
- **Machine running out of RAM → hibernate a task.** The header shows how many gigabytes are still free; hover it for the breakdown of who ate the rest, dev3's own tasks included. **Hibernate**, on the open task's session bar, stops that task's agent, terminal, and dev server and frees its ports, while the worktree, your uncommitted changes, notes, and PR state stay untouched. It asks for confirmation first, and spells out the one thing that does not survive: the terminal scrollback. The card greys out and sinks below the live tasks; waking is explicit — open its terminal and pick a plain shell or a resume of the agent's conversation.
- **Rate limit closing in → hot-swap the account.** The header carries live Claude/Codex rate-limit usage and yellows near the cap; click it to land in **Settings → Agent Accounts**, where several logins per agent CLI sit side by side and the active one switches without a re-login (add one by running the login command dev3 hands you, then verify — or import the login you already have). The switch applies to every *new* agent session dev3 launches — new tasks, spawned agents, bug hunters, auto-review — while running sessions keep theirs, and each launch can pick a non-default account. An **API profile** replaces the subscription login entirely: the Anthropic API, an Anthropic-compatible gateway (OpenRouter, a LiteLLM proxy), or Bedrock, with per-model overrides.
- **Stats** — productivity and token-cost dashboards across projects.
- **Automations** — recurring scheduled agent runs on a cron.
- **Multi-window** — a second window (⇧⌘N) for a second project on another monitor.

## Sibling skills

- **\`/dev3\`** — the task lifecycle protocol every managed agent follows (loaded automatically in worktrees).
- **\`/dev3-project-config\`** — analyze a repo and write its \`.dev3/config.json\`.
- **\`/dev3-tmux\`** — full tmux reference: panes, windows, capturing output.
- **\`/dev3-bug-hunter\`** — seeded, review-only bug hunting; shines in multi-variant swarms.

## When the map is not enough — read the source

dev3 is open source: **https://github.com/h0x91b/dev-3.0**. If the answer isn't on this map, don't guess — go read:

- **Decision records** — \`decisions/YYYY/MM/DD/short-slug.md\` — the *why* behind non-obvious behavior, workarounds, and trade-offs. Best first stop for "why does dev3 do X this way?".
- **Changelogs** — \`change-logs/YYYY/MM/DD/*.md\` — one plain-text entry per shipped change. Answers "when did X appear?" and "what changed recently?".

How to reach it: if this machine has a local checkout (e.g. a \`dev-3.0\` project on the dev3 board — check \`git worktree list\` or the projects list), read files directly; otherwise fetch from GitHub (\`gh api\`, raw.githubusercontent.com, or a web fetch). Cite what you found — file and section — rather than paraphrasing from memory.

## dev-3.0 Managed Worktree

If your working directory (PWD) is inside \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\` (i.e. \`$HOME/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`), you are a **dev-3.0 managed AI agent** with a Kanban task assigned. Regular git worktrees or other paths containing "worktrees" do **NOT** qualify — only the dev-3.0 managed directory under the user's home.

**MANDATORY — do this BEFORE any other work:**

1. Invoke the \`/dev3\` skill (or load \`~/.agents/skills/dev3/SKILL.md\` if skills are not supported).
2. Follow the agent-specific status section in the loaded dev3 skill. Hook-aware agents must never duplicate normal lifecycle transitions manually; agents without hooks must follow the skill's manual start/end protocol.

Do NOT skip these steps, even if the user gives a direct command.

**Codex shell note:** For \`exec_command\` calls, always set \`shell="/bin/bash"\` and \`login=false\`. The sandbox may block homebrew zsh.
