/**
 * The held `dev3 message`: the WHOLE message — its text and its Enter — waits for the
 * pane to go quiet, so nothing an agent sends is typed into the middle of the line the
 * user is writing (issue #1495).
 *
 * Rules, all load-bearing:
 *  - Nothing reaches the pane before the hold releases. The text used to go in the
 *    moment it arrived and only the Enter was held, which is exactly how a peer's
 *    message got mixed into a half-written prompt.
 *  - ONE hold per pane, never a queue of Enters. Several messages stack their TEXTS
 *    in arrival order and end in exactly one Enter; two Enters for two stacked
 *    messages would split the burst again, which is the original defect.
 *  - The newest registration wins the submit closure, because it carries the freshest
 *    pane pin; the ceiling deadline stays with the FIRST undelivered message.
 *  - A MESSAGE-driven hold keeps the ceiling; a HUMAN-driven one has none, and its quiet
 *    window is four times longer, because a pause to think is part of writing a line. A
 *    stream of senders cannot hold a receiver hostage, but the user's own typing
 *    outranks every deadline — his hold ends with his Enter or with a long silence.
 *  - The user's own plain Enter releases the hold at once: he submitted his line, so
 *    the input box is no longer his and he should watch the message arrive.
 *  - No Enter is sent when no text landed — an Enter into an unknown input box would
 *    submit whatever is sitting in it.
 *  - In-memory and deliberately not persisted. If the app dies inside the window the
 *    message is LOST, and nothing is left in the input box either. Accepted; see
 *    `decisions/2026/08/23/hold-the-agent-message-not-just-its-enter.md`.
 *
 * Only `dev3 message` (immediate and "Send later") is held. Button hand-offs — Create
 * PR, commit, rebase, bug-hunter prompts — type and submit at once.
