/**
 * The git-operation panes, EXECUTED, against throwaway repositories (Seq 1547).
 *
 * These scripts push, rebase and squash-merge — they rewrite history and touch a
 * remote — so "the pane opened" is not evidence about them. What is proved here
 * is that the git operation COMPLETED and that dev3 read the right verdict back:
 *
 *   push     the remote ref actually moved, and the verdict file reads "0"
 *   rebase   the branch is linear on top of the base, verdict "0"
 *   conflict git's own CONFLICT message reaches the pane, verdict NON-zero, and
 *            the script terminates rather than hanging on its own keypress prompt
 *   merge    a squash commit lands with a subject carrying a double quote — the
 *            case `-m '<title>'` mangles under PowerShell 5.1 argument quoting —
 *            and that subject is the branch commit's own message, not the task's
 *            truncated description (Seq 1640)
 *
 * WHY IT MUST RUN ON WINDOWS: the whole defect class here is invisible from
 * macOS. Two examples this file exists to catch, both of which look like success
 * from a POSIX run:
 *   - the verdict file's ENCODING. PowerShell 5.1's `>` is `Out-File`, which
 *     writes UTF-16LE with a byte-order mark. Measured on windows-latest: Bun's
 *     text decoder copes with that, so the decoded read still says "0" — which is
 *     exactly why the bytes are asserted too. dev3 must not depend on an
 *     undocumented decoder behaviour to learn whether a push succeeded.
 *   - a `$LASTEXITCODE` left over from a previous command reports a push that
 *     never launched as successful.
 * The POSIX legs are the control that none of this changed macOS/Linux.
 *
 * Run: bun run test:git-op-pane   (all three platforms)
