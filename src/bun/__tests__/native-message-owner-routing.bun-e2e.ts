/**
 * PRODUCT end-to-end proof that a message entering a dev3 app process that does
 * NOT own a native pane's writer lease is still delivered — exactly once, by the
 * process that does own it (seq 1377). Run: `bun run test:native-message-e2e`.
 *
 * Two REAL processes share one isolated `$HOME`:
 *
 *   • **app A** — a child process (`--role=owner`). It creates the task's native
 *     pane set through `pty.createNativeTaskSession`, therefore holds the pane's
 *     writer lease, and runs the REAL `startSocketServer()`, so the production
 *     `_native.deliverPrompt` handler is what answers the forwarded delivery.
 *   • **app B** — this parent process. The message enters here. It binds the same
 *     pane (an OBSERVER, because A holds the lease) and calls the production seam
 *     `deliverAgentPrompt(task, text)`.
 *
 * The delivery is then driven a SECOND time through the full outside-in path
 * (seq 1381): app B runs its own real `startSocketServer()`, a real project and
 * task are persisted to the isolated `$HOME`, and the request arrives over B's
 * CLI socket as the production `message.send` handler — the exact transport
 * `dev3 message` uses. Calling `deliverAgentPrompt` directly proves the seam;
 * only this proves the seam is actually REACHED from the CLI in a non-owning
 * process, with task resolution, envelope handling and the handler's reply in
 * the loop. The task's `tmuxSocket` points at the throwaway sentinel socket, so
 * a silent tmux fallback anywhere in that chain would show up as a session on a
 * socket whose list is asserted byte-identical.
 *
 * What it asserts: the lease really lives in A; `deliverAgentPrompt` reports unconfirmed
 * in B; `message.send` entering B over its own socket answers delivered; each
 * token lands in native pane-1 with its submit CR; each occurs EXACTLY once and
 * is still exactly once well past the submit delay; the bytes were written by A
 * and never by B; host/shell pids are unchanged; no second native session or
 * host was spawned; and no tmux session was created or mutated.
 *
 * Isolation: `$HOME` is a tmpdir — set BEFORE the first `src/` import, because
 * `DEV3_HOME` (and `native-pane-owner`'s sockets dir) are module-load constants.
 * Hence static imports of node builtins only, everything else via `await import`.
 * Registry/host-image/multipane/log dirs are redirected the same way the sibling
 * `native-task-terminal.bun-e2e.ts` does. Test-only: no production file changes.
 *
 * The pane's shell is `stty -echo; exec cat`, so every delivered line comes back
 * on the stream exactly once and an occurrence count is meaningful evidence.
 *
 * Both halves own listeners and timers, so each ends in an explicit process.exit.
