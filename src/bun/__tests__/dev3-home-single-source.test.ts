 * Tripwire for the trap that caused the original bug: `DEV3_HOME` names BOTH a
 * derived constant and an environment variable. While the constant ignored the
 * variable, three modules honoured the variable and the app did not, so a
 * redirected instance was half-scoped — and every individual file looked right.
 *
 * They agree now, because the constant is built from the variable. This test keeps
 * them that way by failing when a module composes the data root from a user home
 * itself instead of going through `resolveDev3Home`.
