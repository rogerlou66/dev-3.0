/**
 * Re-assert dev3's Claude hooks right before a prompt is typed into an agent.
 *
 * Hooks are installed once at launch, but `.claude/settings.local.json` is not
 * ours: Claude Code rewrites the whole file from its own in-memory snapshot when
 * the user answers a permission or `.mcp.json` prompt, and an MCP server or a
 * user hook can rewrite it too. A snapshot taken before our hooks landed puts
 * the file back without them, and the task then silently stops moving between
 * columns for the rest of the session.
 *
 * Sending a prompt is the one moment that is both frequent and free: the write
 * is skipped entirely when the file already carries our hooks, so the steady
 * state costs one read.
 *
 * Claude only. Codex reads its dev3 hooks from a `-c hooks=...` override fixed at
 * launch, so rewriting `.codex/hooks.json` mid-session would change nothing.
