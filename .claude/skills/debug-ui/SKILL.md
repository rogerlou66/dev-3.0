# debug-ui — QA the dev-3.0 UI in a real browser

See and drive the running dev-3.0 UI in headless Chromium — click, type, screenshot, read
console errors — instead of guessing whether a UI change works. No desktop/native dependency;
it works the same in a plain terminal session.

This is **dev-internal tooling for the dev-3.0 repo** — NOT one of the skills dev3 ships to
its users (those live in `src/bun/agent-skills.ts`).

## The whole flow

This task's dev-server **is** the web UI: `bun run dev` serves the full app in local remote
mode at a stable per-machine token and a CLI-derivable port — no separate `dev3 remote`. The
loop is always the same four beats: **values → server → browser → clean up.**

```bash
# 1. Values. AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION isolates THIS task's browser from every other agent's —
#    without it all agents share one global "default" session and stomp each other (see
#    Gotchas). Derived from the always-present $DEV3_TASK_ID, so this exact line is
#    copy-paste-safe at the top of ANY block that calls agent-browser.
export AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION="dev3-${DEV3_TASK_ID%%-*}"
CODE=$(cat "$HOME/.dev3.0/dev-web-access-code" 2>/dev/null || bun scripts/dev-web-code.ts)
PORT=${DEV3_PORT0:-$(dev3 dev-server status | grep -oE 'DEV3_PORT0=[0-9]+' | cut -d= -f2)}

# 2. Start a FRESH dev-server and wait for it to come up. (Skip the start only if one is
#    already running for THIS task — but see the build-snapshot gotcha: stale code needs a
#    restart, so when in doubt restart.)
dev3 dev-server start
until curl -sf "http://localhost:$PORT/?token=$CODE" >/dev/null; do sleep 2; done

# 3. Drive it. Every agent-browser call inherits AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION, so it all runs in
#    this task's own session. (Load /agent-browser for the full command set.) The screenshot
#    path is task-scoped too, so parallel agents never overwrite each other's PNG.
#    `&streamer=on` is MANDATORY: it enables streamer mode (privacy masking), so screenshots
#    can't leak the developer's real emails/accounts/paths/tunnel URLs (see Gotchas).
#    Keep `set viewport` BEFORE `open`, and keep the width ≥ 1024 for desktop QA — the app's
#    mobile gate reads `screen.width` (see Gotchas).
agent-browser set viewport 1440 900
agent-browser open "http://localhost:$PORT/?token=$CODE&streamer=on"
agent-browser wait --load networkidle
sleep 2                                       # networkidle can still land mid-render — let it settle
agent-browser snapshot -i -d 6                # prove it's DRIVABLE, not just screenshot-able
agent-browser screenshot "/tmp/dev3-ui-${DEV3_TASK_ID%%-*}.png"   # then Read it back to look
agent-browser errors                          # confirm no console errors

# 4. Always clean up what you started. `close` closes only THIS session's browser.
agent-browser close
dev3 dev-server stop          # the port frees a second or two later (graceful shutdown)
```

That's it. `DEV3_REMOTE_PORT=${DEV3_PORT0:-0}` is wired into the repo's `dev` script and
`portCount: 1` is committed in `.dev3/config.json`, so the dev app binds the exact port shown
above (see [decision 093](../../../decisions/2026/06/30/dev-remote-port-from-pool.md)).

## Scoped QA: a throwaway board instead of the real one

`dev3 dev-server start` boots a full dev3 instance on **your real board** — another task's
"Branch Merged — mark completed?" dialog is live and clickable in your browser, and another task's
terminal is reachable by navigation. For anything that does not specifically need real data, run the
scoped instance instead:

```bash
dev3 pane run "cd $PWD && bun run dev --qa"     # throwaway board: one fixture project, zero tasks
dev3 pane run "cd $PWD && bun run dev --qa=virgin"   # completely empty home — first-run state
dev3 pane logs <run-id>                          # it prints the scoped DEV3_HOME and a reset line
```

It binds the same `DEV3_PORT0` and prints the port, so steps 3–4 of the flow above are unchanged.
The scoped root is stable per worktree, so a restart reuses the same board; `rm -rf` the printed
root to start over.

**What it does NOT isolate** — name these rather than assuming a clean room: the tmux socket
directory (only `TMUX_TMPDIR` moves it, and dev3 sets it nowhere), the PowerShell history file on
Windows, the user's own `~/.codex` / `~/.claude` agent configs, and `dev3` CLI commands run from
inside a REAL worktree (cwd-based task detection outranks `$DEV3_HOME` by design).

## Gotchas

- **The browser is a machine-global singleton — isolate per task or agents stomp each other.**
  Every `agent-browser` call with no session lands in one shared `"default"` session: one
  browser process, one global viewport. When two task agents QA at the same time they collide
  — agent B's `open` silently replaces agent A's page, so A's next `screenshot` captures B's
  UI. The fix is step 1: `export AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION="dev3-${DEV3_TASK_ID%%-*}"` gives each
  task its own isolated session/profile (verify with `agent-browser session` / `session
  list`), and `agent-browser close` then closes only your session. **The Bash tool
  reinitializes the shell per call, so an `export` does not carry across separate
  invocations** — the line derives from the always-present `$DEV3_TASK_ID`, so just repeat it
  at the top of each block, or pass `--session "dev3-${DEV3_TASK_ID%%-*}"` on every command.
  (If you ever must share one browser machine-wide instead, serialize QA across agents so only
  one drives at a time.)
- **The dev-server is a build snapshot — no watch/HMR.** Your code only appears after a
  (re)start. After changing code, `dev3 dev-server restart`, re-wait for the port, then
  `agent-browser reload` — a bare reload re-serves the *old* bundle. Don't keep a stale server
  around; never hand-run `vite build`.
- **Is the running build actually yours?** An already-running app/remote is often production or
  *another* worktree — it won't have your changes. (Re)start THIS task's dev-server and confirm
  with `dev3 --version` (commit hash should match `git log -1`) + that your change actually
  renders. Don't assume.
- **Tell the user before `dev3 dev-server start`** (visible side effect), and stop it after
  (step 4) unless they want it kept.
- **No `DEV3_PORT0`?** (portCount 0, or an older worktree where it was never allocated) — run
  your own fixed-port server instead:
  `dev3 remote --no-detach --no-tunnel --static-code $CODE --port 47823` → `:47823/?token=$CODE`.
- **Every screenshot in streamer mode — no exceptions by default.** The app shows the
  developer's REAL identity (account emails, orgs, home-dir paths, tunnel URLs, QR codes), and
  a QA screenshot easily ends up in a PR/issue/recording. `&streamer=on` in the URL forces the
  privacy masking on for the whole session (it persists in this session's localStorage;
  `&streamer=off` forces it back off). The masking is CSS blur on `.streamer-private` elements
  — see `src/mainview/streamer-mode.tsx` and decision 161. Only capture unmasked when the task
  is explicitly about those values (e.g. testing the accounts UI itself), and say so when
  presenting the image.
- **App renders but nothing clicks? That's the mobile gate, not the tooling.** The app decides
  mobile from the *physical* `screen.width` (`< 1024` → mobile; `src/mainview/hooks/useMobile.tsx`,
  deliberately not `innerWidth`), and a mobile device held in landscape gets
  `MobilePortraitGate`: a "rotate your device" overlay plus `inert` on the whole app — screenshots
  still work, clicks do nothing. `agent-browser` 0.6.0 emulated `screen.*` together with the
  viewport, so `set viewport 1440 900` before `open` was enough. **0.34.0 does not** — `screen`
  stays at the headless display's 800×600 no matter the viewport (`--window-size` in `--args`
  does not move it either), so every desktop QA run lands in the gate. Override it with an init
  script instead, registered before the first navigation:

  ```bash
  printf 'for (const k of ["width","availWidth"]) Object.defineProperty(screen, k, { get: () => 1600, configurable: true });\nfor (const k of ["height","availHeight"]) Object.defineProperty(screen, k, { get: () => 1000, configurable: true });\n' > /tmp/screen-desktop.js
  agent-browser close                      # a running session keeps its old init scripts
  agent-browser set viewport 1600 1000
  agent-browser open "http://localhost:$PORT/?token=$CODE&streamer=on" --init-script /tmp/screen-desktop.js
  ```

  With that, `screen.width` reports 1600 and the gate stays off. You otherwise only hit the gate
  by asking for a phone-sized landscape viewport — that is the app working as designed.
  Measured across the common sizes: `2560×1440`, `1920×1080`, `1600×900`, `1440×900`, `1366×768`,
  `1280×720`, `1024×768`, `768×1024` and phone portrait `390×844` all render and click fine
  (`screen.width` always equals the requested width); only landscape `844×390` shows the gate, goes
  `inert`, and reports **zero** interactive elements in `snapshot -i` — that count is the fastest
  tell. Diagnose in one call:
  `agent-browser eval "JSON.stringify({sw:screen.width,gate:!!document.querySelector('[data-testid=\"mobile-portrait-gate\"]'),inert:!!document.querySelector('[inert]')})"`.
  If a future browser tool pins `screen.*` to the real headless display and desktop QA goes inert,
  that's the moment to add an escape hatch to the app — not before (see
  [the headless-QA decision](../../../decisions/2026/08/14/headless-qa-mobile-gate-stays-as-is.md)).
- **No native dialogs** in browser mode. If a confirm/file-picker flow silently no-ops, that's
  an app bug, not a tooling problem — report it.
- **Show images to the user AFTER you stop this dev-server, not while it runs.**
  `dev3 show-image` (and `dev3 attention` / `dev3 notify`) route to the app instance that owns
  the task — and this QA dev-server is itself a full dev3 instance. While it's up, those
  UI-attention calls can land in *it* (the browser only you see) instead of the user's main
  app, so the user never sees the image. Screenshots persist on disk, so the correct order is
  **capture → `dev3 dev-server stop` (confirm `State: stopped`) → `dev3 show-image`**.
