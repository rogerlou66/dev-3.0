# Remote access

dev-3.0 can run headless and serve its full UI to any browser — a laptop on the same LAN, a
phone anywhere in the world, or your desktop over an SSH tunnel. Same board, same terminals,
same live previews.

```sh
dev3 remote
```

That's the whole thing. It prints an ASCII QR code, a public URL, and an SSH-forward hint.

## How the connection works

The access URL is signed with a short-lived JWT — **65 seconds, single use** — and the QR
auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Once you scan it, the client keeps a rolling trusted session for
24 hours and reconnects on reload without rescanning.

## Android tablet app

Open the dev3 Android app and scan the same QR code. The tablet loads the shared boards, task
controls, settings, diffs and terminals from the computer, while prompt composition, notifications,
streamed artifact saving, external links and Android Back stay native. Task and project prompts are edited outside
the WebView; only confirmed task delivery clears a draft, and ambiguous delivery is never retried
automatically.

HTTPS, SSH forwarding and Tailscale are the preferred transports. A private LAN `http://` link is
still unencrypted: Android requires a separate warning confirmation, keeps a visible warning while
connected and disables native handoffs that could launch content silently. Choosing **Forget
computer** revokes that rolling server session before removing its local cookie.

Three ways in, printed on every start:

| | Route | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| ① | **Cloudflare quick tunnel** (default) | From anywhere, no SSH setup. `cloudflared` ships as a brew dependency |
| ② | **LAN** | Scan the QR from any device on the same network |
| ③ | **SSH port-forward** | Most private — nothing is publicly exposed: `ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> user@<server>` |

Pass `--no-tunnel` to skip the public tunnel entirely (LAN + SSH only).

## Background lifecycle (for SSH boxes)

`dev3 remote` backgrounds the server by default, so it survives your SSH session. From any
later session:

```sh
dev3 remote status          # running? PID, port, uptime
dev3 remote url             # fresh QR + URL to re-scan from your phone
dev3 remote logs --follow   # tail ~/.dev3.0/remote/remote.log live
dev3 remote restart         # relaunch (accepts start flags, e.g. --port 3000)
dev3 remote stop            # SIGTERM, then SIGKILL fallback
```

Add `--no-detach` to keep it in the foreground instead — required when a supervisor owns the
process (systemd `Type=simple`, a Docker `CMD`, …).

## Keeping the box up to date

A remote box is the one place where "there is an update, press restart" never gets pressed —
nobody opens a terminal on it. So it updates itself.

**By hand, from anywhere:**

```sh
dev3 update --check     # is there anything newer?
dev3 update --dry-run   # which install method was detected, and what would it run
dev3 update             # do it
```

`dev3 update` works out how this dev3 was installed — Homebrew formula, Homebrew cask, or a
plain CLI tarball — and does the right thing for it. On the **canary** channel it always uses
the tarball, because the brew tap only ever carries stable. It refuses, with the reason
printed, when it cannot safely touch the install: running from source, Windows (no CLI
tarball yet), a macOS `.app` Homebrew does not manage, or a cask whose recorded version has
drifted behind the running app. Refusals exit `15`.

**By itself, once the box is quiet.** The server checks every 30 minutes and installs the
update on its own when all three of these have held together for 10 minutes:

- no task in the **In Progress** column,
- no terminal producing output,
- no browser connected.

Past **72 hours** of waiting, only the first condition still applies — otherwise one browser
tab left open on a phone could pin the box on an old build forever. Turn the whole thing off
in **Settings → System → "Update a remote box on its own"** to hold a box on one build while
you investigate something.

**The restart keeps your link.** The dying server hands its port and its *live* `cloudflared`
process to the replacement, so the `*.trycloudflare.com` URL does not change, the host-bound
session cookie still matches, and the browser reconnects on its own. Running agents survive
too — their tmux sessions are detached and task lifecycles are rehydrated at boot.

Two caveats worth knowing:

- **Under systemd** the unit's cgroup is torn down when the unit stops, which takes
  `cloudflared` with it. The update still happens (systemd relaunches the unit), but the
  public URL **changes** — re-run `dev3 remote url`.
- **There is no "updating…" screen.** A silent overnight restart looks exactly like the box
  falling over. `dev3 remote status` prints a `Last update:` line that explains it.

## Run it as a service (Linux)

```sh
dev3 remote install-service --port 3017   # systemd --user unit, enabled on boot
dev3 remote uninstall-service
```

Tip: `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER` keeps user services running while you are logged out.
Under systemd the log goes to the journal: `journalctl --user -u dev3-remote.service -f`.

## Useful start flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--port <n>` | Bind a fixed TCP port instead of a random one (ideal for `docker -p 3000:3000` or a preconfigured `ssh -L`) |
| `--no-tunnel` | No Cloudflare tunnel — LAN + SSH forward only |
| `--expose-ports=3000,5173` | Also publish your dev-server ports through their own quick tunnels (one URL per port). Retries for 60 s until each port is actually listening |
| `--no-detach` | Stay in the foreground; Ctrl-C stops it |
| `--views-dir <path>` | Serve static assets from a different directory |

`--static-code=<value>` replaces the rotating token with a fixed one. **Local development
only** — never expose a static code on the public internet.

## Security notes

- The rotating token is the only credential; treat a live tunnel URL as a live session.
- Diagnostic logs are kept for 14 days locally and redact prompt-bearing payloads and command
  arguments — see [Local diagnostic logs](diagnostic-logs.md).
- SSH port-forwarding exposes nothing publicly and reuses your existing SSH credentials. It is
  the right default for anything sensitive.

`dev3 remote --help` prints the complete flag reference.
