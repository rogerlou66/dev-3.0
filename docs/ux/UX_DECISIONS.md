# UX Decisions

Compact index of UX architecture decisions — the *why* behind rules that live in
`PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` / `ux-architecture.yaml`. Max ~5 lines per entry; details live in
git history, PRs, and the records in `decisions/`. Newest first.

**2026-09-02 — Blocked reviews:** Persistent hold, formal column/tier, no Inbox/Needs You; existing drag/status menus own it. Why: `decisions/2026/09/02/blocked-review-hold.md`.

**Settled fork decisions → bible §5/§12 and yaml:** Aug 19–27, 2026: questions projection, Completed disclosure/search, Board shortcut, Android shell, workspace overlay, project-priority swimlanes. Evidence: `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `WorkspaceTaskOverlay.tsx`, `android/`.

**2026-08-28 — Workspace Inbox:** Fixed horizontal Inbox duplicates actionable questions/reviews above the grid; counter-clockwise left rail, distinct AI Review, Done disclosure, empty-row New Task. Evidence: `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`; bible §5.

## 2026-08-25 — Agent traffic: a conditional header readout plus an overlay log

- **Rule:** bible §5.9 / yaml `agent_traffic_log` — the readout lives in the kebab and earns a bar slot only while unread traffic exists (never on a phone bar), the log is an overlay (not a 9th destination), and no importance axis may be invented over the delivery verdict the rows already carry.
- **Why:** the rows were already on disk with no reader, and the rejected alternatives — a permanent header counter, or a recency-based glyph — both put a number nobody acts on in the header of boards where agents never talk.
- **Status:** proposed. Record: `decisions/2026/08/25/agent-traffic-readout-and-log.md`.

## 2026-08-23 — A guided tour points; it does not drive

- **Rule:** one tour mechanism (`mainview/tour.ts` + `TourOverlay`, `data-tour-anchor`, bible §5.4b): a step rings a real control, never performs it, and progress is read from the DOM.
- **Record:** `decisions/2026/08/23/a-guided-tour-points-it-does-not-drive.md`.
- **Status:** Observed.

## 2026-08-22 — The ordinary task terminal is owed help coverage
- **Rule:** the immersive-fullscreen exemption in the §5.4 coverage floor does not cover the task screen's terminal (`terminal.task`), and a twice-rendered surface needs its own guard because reachability cannot tell which branch mounted a zone. **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/22/help-mode-was-blind-on-the-task-screen.md`.

## 2026-08-22 — A first-run-only action lives in the first-run strip
- **Rule:** the sandbox button sits inside the dashboard's first-run strip, never beside `Add project` — bible §5.4a. **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/22/the-sandbox-is-a-real-repo-dev3-owns.md`.

## 2026-08-22 — Blast-radius copy is not an info icon; the nav budget is 8, spent
- **Rule:** a dialog acting on the user's own files or remotes states what dev3 writes, where, and what it pushes — bible §10, §4/§9. **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/22/blast-radius-copy-is-not-an-info-icon.md`.

## 2026-08-22 — First run advertises help mode; the tour ban is lifted
- **Rule:** the header `?` rests highlighted on `dashboard`/`project`/`task`/`project-settings` until help mode is opened once; the first-run panel takes the stats card's slot rather than adding one; an empty state may not name a control its column lacks; no tips at zero tasks. Bible §5.4a, §5.4, §10; tours are now §5.4b.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/22/first-run-advertises-help-mode.md`.

## 2026-08-21 — Prompt presets share one picker under the description
- **Rule:** preamble-injecting task types (Coordinator, PR review) live in one `Task type` radiogroup under the description, never as scattered toggles — `CreateTaskModal.tsx`.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/21/coordinator-task-type-preset.md`.

## 2026-08-21 — The manifest owns placement; the `better-*` skills own craft
- **Rule:** `ux-principal` is mandatory only for a change that adds a destination, surface or action (or pushes a budget); craft on an existing control goes to the owning `better-*` skill. §9a keeps only dev3's deltas — bible §1/§9a.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/21/split-ux-principal-from-the-better-skills.md`.

## 2026-08-20 — The board card carries the dev server: one split control, open | stop

- **Rule:** `dev_server_action` gains one placement on `task_card.actions` — a single split control (open the lowest dev port | stop), conditional on active + worktree + resolved `devScript` + not hibernated; start/restart/logs stay in the inspector. The card's inline-action budget is reconciled 2 → 4 (shipped code already ran 3) and is now full. Bible §5, §9; yaml `dev-server-control-on-task-card`.
- **Why:** "Which task is serving, on which port" was answerable only by opening each task, and a forgotten dev server is a machine-wide cost; stop earns the card because reversal is one click, while start does not. Rejected: a read-only signals badge (cannot stop anything) and hiding the control when stopped (the row reflows exactly when a server dies).
- **Status:** Planned (task #1602). Evidence: `TaskCard.tsx`, `task-info-panel/TaskDevServer.tsx`, `types.ts (DevServerStatus)`.

## 2026-08-20 — A rendered document is commented by selecting its text, and must show what it collects

- **Rule:** In the diff viewer's markdown preview, a text selection raises a floating `Add comment` button that opens the shared composer and writes to the same per-file/per-side/per-line thread as a gutter comment (blocks carry `data-md-line-start/end` from mdast positions); the preview must also render that file's existing local threads.
- **Why:** A rendered document has no gutter, so the only trigger the medium offers is the selection itself — a toolbar "comment mode" toggle was rejected as a mode switch plus a toolbar slot for one action, and a per-block hover `+` was rejected as chrome on every paragraph. Creating comments without rendering them was rejected outright: the preview replaces the diff, so the click would look like a no-op.
- **Status:** Proposed. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/pr-review/markdown-diff.tsx`, bible §5.3.

## 2026-08-22 — A breadcrumb chevron switches that segment's own object

- **Rule:** The task `#seq-N` badge is a segmented control whose chevron opens the shared variant menu, mirroring the project segment; it appears only with ≥2 live variants. Bible §4 Breadcrumbs, yaml `breadcrumbs.rules`. Why: `decisions/2026/08/22/breadcrumb-variant-switcher.md`.

## 2026-08-19 — A data-bearing menu row opens on hover, its flyout beside the menu — rule now lives in bible §12.6.
## 2026-08-17 — A Space filters the dashboard; it never becomes a place
- **Rule:** Spaces group projects on the dashboard only — a rail that FILTERS the overview, collapsible group headers, row membership chips + a `Spaces…` action, and **every space action behind one `…`**; no space route, no merged board, no colour, no stored `Home` (it is computed from zero-membership projects).
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/17/spaces-dashboard-follows-the-proposal-mock.md`.

## 2026-08-21 — The dashboard's spaces surface is calm, container-gated, and stream-safe
- **Rule:** One `…` per space on both surfaces (rail row + group header) holding `Edit projects…` (two-way membership), move, rename, delete, hide-on-camera; no add-only `+` — bible §10.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/21/one-menu-per-space-on-every-surface.md`, `decisions/2026/08/21/rail-gated-on-container-width.md`, `decisions/2026/08/21/space-filter-survives-the-rail.md`.

## 2026-08-17 — A stored secret is read-only until the user reveals it

- **Rule:** A settings field holding a saved credential renders a mask and is READ-ONLY; a resting-visible eye icon (`icon`/ghost, labelled + `aria-pressed`) fetches that one secret on click via its own RPC, and only then is the field editable — where emptying it means "remove the key". The revealed value carries `streamer-private`.
- **Why:** editing a secret you cannot see half-overwrites working keys and makes "clear to remove" impossible to offer, so the reveal is the edit gate; rejected alternative — send every key with the catalog and mask it client-side (a credential would cross to the renderer, including over a remote tunnel, because a screen loaded).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/ux-architecture.yaml` `stored-secret-revealed-before-edit`, `src/mainview/components/global-settings/ModelCatalogSection.tsx` (`ProviderKeyField`), `src/bun/rpc-handlers/model-catalog.ts` (`modelCatalogRevealKey`).

## 2026-08-14 — An agent-to-agent message toast names two tasks and owns its own hue
- **Rule:** The toast for `dev3 message` between two agents renders `#fromSeq title → #toSeq title` as its source line, uses the non-severity `agent` variant (violet `--agent`), and clicks through to the RECEIVER; every other toast keeps one origin and a severity variant.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/14/agent-message-toast-two-identities.md`.

## 2026-08-14 — An agent-written log gets a capped preview, not a whole screen

- **Rule:** Object-scoped content an agent appends to without a ceiling (task notes) shows the newest 3 entries on the object's surface, each body clamped to 6 lines with an overflow-gated Show more, plus a count and one `Show all N` row into its own overlay (BottomSheet narrow / dialog wide).
- **Why:** 2 999 of 3 030 notes are agent-written and the tail is 143 notes / 313 321 chars — 45 900 px of scroll in the mobile actions sheet — but the median task holds exactly one 790-char note, so the rejected alternative (move the whole section behind a row + count badge) taxed >75% of tasks with a tap to fix 5%.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §5.8 + §10, `src/mainview/components/TaskNotesOverlay.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/task-info-panel/TaskNotes.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — Settings → Agents is a preset library, not nested accordions

- **Rule:** A Settings entry owning dozens of same-shaped records renders a filterable list plus exactly one detail editor inside the category pane, grouped by the labels the consuming surface already shows (Agents: the launch picker's Model → Mode); narrow shows the list first, then the editor with a back affordance.
- **Why:** 98 shipped presets behind three accordion levels with no search made finding or editing one a scroll hunt, and opening an editor pushed the other 39 rows off-screen; the rejected alternative — a dense sortable table with a drawer — buys bulk actions nobody asked for at the price of a data-grid pattern Settings has no precedent for.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §8, `src/mainview/components/global-settings/AgentSettingsSection.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — One dropdown, optionally searchable and creatable

- **Rule:** `Select.tsx` stays the app's only dropdown; `searchable` adds an in-panel filter input and `allowCustom` commits typed text as the value, so a shipped enum can never block a value the agent CLI already accepts.
- **Why:** Model ids, permission modes and effort levels change faster than dev3 ships, and a fixed list silently caps the user at yesterday's options; a separate Combobox component was rejected because the app would then own two dropdowns with two keyboard contracts.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §7, `src/mainview/components/Select.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/__tests__/Select.test.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — Whose-code identity is accent on the board, warning only on the diff
- **Rule:** `Task.foreignCode` renders as an accent eye glyph (§5.6, second identity marker) on the card and inspector, while the `warning`-toned RUNS badge sits on changed executable-config files in the diff viewer.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/10/trust-the-branch-not-the-project.md`.

## 2026-08-10 — A send marks the review, it never deletes it
- **Rule:** No send path (per-comment, composer `Send now`, or batch) may clear inline review comments; they are stamped `Sent`, and only the confirmed `Reset review` destroys anything.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/10/never-destroy-a-review-on-send.md`.

## 2026-08-10 — Review export card is a title line; the composer owns the one-shot send

- **Rule:** The export cluster (count + Copy + Send + icon-only Reset) sits on the card's title line, renders nothing when the review is empty, and the count is plain text — never a bordered box; the composer gains `Send now`, which delivers one remark and drops it.
- **Why:** A reviewer's single remark cost three clicks (add → send → delete) and the card spent a third of the aside on two full-width rare-use buttons plus a boxed number that read as an editable input; keeping the batch buttons full-width was rejected as the thing being complained about.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (`addAndSendInlineComment`, `InlineCommentComposer`), bible §5.3.

## 2026-08-08 — The memory breakdown may kill leftover worktree processes, and nothing else
- **Rule:** one conditional section at the bottom of the dev3 group in the memory popover/BottomSheet lists processes still running inside task worktrees; three ghost-danger controls — `Kill all` behind `confirm({ danger: true })`, a hover-revealed per-row kill with no dialog, and a rescan icon — bible §12.6 + yaml; yaml `global_header.ambient_resource_readout.reclaim_action`.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/08/reap-worktree-cwd-holders-on-teardown.md`.

## 2026-08-08 — An archived task reaches its images and artifacts as enumerated rows
- **Rule:** the archived (completed/cancelled) task modal lists every `dev3 show-image` image and `dev3 show-artifact` artifact as its own clickable row above Notes (`SharedOutputsList.tsx`); rows open the App-hosted viewers at their own index, the artifact viewer as a standalone overlay — bible §3 + yaml; yaml `task_image_viewer.reached_from`.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/08/archived-task-shared-outputs.md`.

## 2026-08-08 — On a phone the memory readout folds into the kebab like everything else

- **Rule:** the global header's ambient resource readout (memory headroom) is a roomy-width slot only; on narrow it moves into the kebab bottom sheet next to `PreventSleepToggle` / `RateLimitIndicator`, keeps its ≥44px target there, and still opens its breakdown as a `BottomSheet`. Bible §12.6, yaml `surfaces.global_header.ambient_resource_readout.narrow`, `responsive.global_header`. Supersedes the narrow half of the 2026-07-30 entry below.
- **Why:** the 2026-07-30 rule argued the readout matters most where screen is scarce — in practice a phone header has room for a breadcrumb and one kebab, and a number the user does not act on at a glance is exactly what should give that room back. The desktop half of the rule is unchanged: capacity is still permanent chrome at roomy widths, still capped at one.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `MemoryHeadroomIndicator.tsx`, seq 1463.

## 2026-08-08 — A phone scales per screen: dense to work in, roomy to browse
- **Rule:** the phone's root font-size factor is chosen by route, not fixed.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/08/phone-density-is-per-screen-not-global.md`.

## 2026-08-07 — A narrow control row sheds; it never stacks

- **Rule:** bible §12.6 (`flex-nowrap`, written priority order, container-query thresholds, a sheet path for anything shed) + §12.3 for the diff viewer's four modes.
- **Why:** a second row costs a phone a whole band of screen and moves every control the user was aiming at, which is worse than losing the least important one; measured at 340px the summary bar went 40px → 67px tall. Rejected: JS measured overflow via `ResizeObserver` (oscillates once hiding an item shrinks `scrollWidth`, and needs an offscreen clone to recover the natural width); a viewport breakpoint (the row is not the window — the same width holds a different bar depending on whether a variant switcher and output badges exist); folding the readouts unconditionally (they are status, and §12.6 keeps them resting-visible whenever they fit).
- **Refinement (seq 1676):** the diff sheds its *width*, not the control — `decisions/2026/08/25/mobile-diff-chip-pins-the-diff-mode.md`.
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` (`task-summary-bar`, `diff-summary-badge`, `summary-bar-diff-compact`), `TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (narrow mode row), seq 1459, seq 1676.

## 2026-08-07 — The Active Tasks sidebar row carries the Kanban card's lifecycle rail
- **Rule:** the sidebar row mounts `TaskCardRail` with `autoLabel` — ring, bell and the glued ✓ → Completed always, and the upright status word only when the rail measures tall enough to hold it whole — then title → signals → a muted identity line; the agent config no longer opens the row — bible §5.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/07/sidebar-rail-short-labels.md`.

## 2026-08-07 — Every toast has one anatomy, and its origin is resolved centrally

- **Rule:** Where a toast came from never changes its shape: source line → message → click target → swipe **and** X **and** timeout. The line falls back task → project → app area (`Settings`/`Update`/`Dashboard`/`Terminal`/`Menu`), first match wins, so no toast is ever bare; an area is a label with no click target. A caller passes ONE token (`taskId`/`projectId`/`source`) and `ToastHost` composes the rest via a resolver injected by `App.tsx`, once at emit, never per render. Bible §5.7, yaml `surfaces.toast`.
- **Why:** with many parallel tasks a bare sentence cannot say which task it is about — CLI push toasts already carried the source line, in-app ones did not. Rejected: composing `context`/`onClick` at each of ~180 call sites (drifts again on the next toast anyone writes); letting `toast.tsx` import app state (a module-level service would depend on the reducer); and stamping every originless toast with `dev-3.0` (a uniform line that carries nothing is fabrication by another route). Resolving per render passed every unit test yet lost a live toast's line and click target as soon as the user left the project — hence once at emit.
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `src/mainview/toast.tsx`, `src/mainview/App.tsx` (`ToastHost` mount, `openTaskFromNotification`), seq 1437.

## 2026-08-06 — Opening a viewed artifact in the real browser is one icon next to download

- **Rule:** The artifact viewer header gets one neutral external-link icon beside download; desktop hands the stored HTML path to the OS browser via RPC, browser/remote opens a blob URL synchronously in the click (§10 hand-off row). The header is now full at six controls.
- **Why:** The real browser owns find, print, zoom, devtools and a window that outlives dev3 navigation, so the escape hatch belongs on the document; a context-menu-only entry was rejected because the viewer has no context menu and would be invisible on touch.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `src/bun/rpc-handlers/app-handlers.ts`.

## 2026-08-05 — A sensitive project is masked, locked and silent — but only while streamer mode is on
- **Rule:** `Project.sensitive` (toggle in Project Settings → Board) is inert until `data-streamer="on"`; then the project name and its task text carry `streamer-private` everywhere outside the project, its dashboard row / picker option stays visible but `aria-disabled` with a lock glyph and an info toast on cl — bible §3 + §10 + yaml; yaml `sensitive-project-masked-locked-and-silent`.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/23/streamer-mode-css-blur-masking.md`.

## 2026-08-05 — The dashboard task row carries exactly one object action: ✓ Complete

- **Rule:** each dashboard task row ends in one ✓ Complete (hover/focus-revealed on desktop, always visible ≥44×44 on narrow, always `alwaysConfirm`, hidden while hibernated) and never gains a second row action, kebab, or context menu. Bible §10 row `object_action — the one dashboard exception`, yaml `placement_rules.dashboard-task-row-single-complete`.
- **Why:** the dashboard is the attention triage list, so clearing a finished row is the job that screen exists for, and the row is the task's own surface rather than app chrome — which is what `task-scoped-actions-in-inspector-or-menu` meant to protect. Rejected: a per-row kebab (turns triage into a second board) and a narrow-only long-press (leaves the desktop pain in the issue unfixed).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ActivityOverview.tsx`, `utils/moveTaskToStatus.ts (onFailure)`, issue #1252.

## 2026-08-05 — Hover raises emphasis; it never creates the control

- **Rule:** An action cluster may not be hidden behind `opacity-0` → `group-hover:opacity-100`. It rests at a visible tone (`text-fg-3`, the quietest step clearing 3:1 on the light theme's `surface-raised`) and hover only lifts it to `text-fg` + `bg-elevated` — destructive to `text-danger` + `bg-danger/10`.
- **Why:** The Dashboard project row hid settings / Finder / project-terminal / remove entirely until hover, so the four actions were undiscoverable and inconsistent with the drag + up/down reorder affordances in the same row, which were already resting-visible. Rejected alternative: keep hover-reveal and only raise the revealed contrast — it fixes legibility but not discoverability.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/ProjectActionButtons.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/ActivityOverview.tsx`.
- **Open tension:** the ✓ Complete action landed on the dashboard *task* row the same day is still hover-revealed on desktop. It is the one known exception to this rule and has not been reconciled yet.

## 2026-08-06 — Agent outputs ride the narrow summary bar, and are duplicated in the sheet

- **Rule:** On narrow, `Images` / `Artifacts` render as conditional 44px readouts on the inspector summary bar next to priority AND stay as rows in the actions sheet (`surfaces.task_inspector`, bible §12.6).
- **Why:** An unread output must be visible without opening a kebab — the same status-not-action logic as the ambient header readout; folding them (the shipped behaviour) hid a produced artifact behind two taps, and the sheet copy is kept because the sheet is the phone's complete action inventory.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/task-info-panel/TaskSharedImages.tsx`.

## 2026-08-03 — Local review comments send one-by-one; the batch send covers only unsent ones

- **Rule:** Every local inline review comment carries its own `Send to agent` (role `secondary`, beside Edit/Delete, sending/sent states + toasts); a sent comment is marked `Sent` and leaves the Review export card's copy/batch-send payload, which is now scoped to unsent comments. Bible §5.3, yaml `surfaces.diff_review_viewer.inline_comment_actions`.
- **Why:** reviewers want a comment delivered the moment they write it, and a batch that still carries already-sent comments makes the agent re-handle them. Rejected: keeping send batch-only (the reported pain) and hiding sent comments from the card (they must stay visible and re-readable).
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/pr-review/GithubThreadView.tsx`.

## 2026-08-03 — A shortcut has a primary slot and an alias slot; presets are not a way to turn shortcuts off
- **Rule:** every shortcut carries two independently-editable slots (primary + optional alias) rather than a flat binding list, and a per-shortcut editor replaces any "compatibility preset" toggle — the iTerm2 preset and its three checkboxes (Settings, ⓘ popover, native Terminal ▸ Keyboard Mode) are deleted, it.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/08/03/shortcut-slots-and-no-iterm2-preset.md`.

## 2026-08-02 — The keymap registry now dispatches, and rebinding lives in Settings, not the ⌘/ overlay

- **Rule:** `keymap.ts` holds machine-readable bindings and drives dispatch (`matchesShortcut(e, id)`); rebinding is `configuration` and belongs to a new eighth Settings category **Keyboard** (which also absorbs the terminal keymap preset), while the ⌘/ overlay stays read-only reference showing the *resolved* combo plus one "Customize…" link. Structural bindings (g-chords, ⌘1–9 families, hold-modifier switcher, Esc) render read-only **with a stated reason**. Bible §5.2, yaml `surfaces.keyboard_shortcuts_editor`.
- **Why:** the 2026-06-19 "registry documents, does not dispatch" split made user rebinding impossible without editing two places, so it had to be reversed; a per-shortcut matcher confines the risk that entry feared to one tested function instead of a rewrite. Rejected: editing inside the ⌘/ overlay (durable configuration in a help surface), and hiding non-remappable rows (an editor that silently omits a third of the keymap reads as broken).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `keymap.ts`, `keymap-bindings.ts`, `KeyboardSettingsSection.tsx`, `ShortcutRow.tsx`, `settings-registry.ts`, `App.tsx`. Supersedes the dispatch half of the 2026-06-19 entry.

## 2026-08-01 — Split resize lives on the boundary, never in a toolbar

- **Rule:** Native terminal split boundaries carry a `role="separator"` grab strip (resting grip, ≥9px hit target, `col-resize`/`row-resize`, ghost line, commit on release, Arrow-key steps) and no control anywhere else; absent for a single pane, a zoomed pane, and the narrow carousel. Bible §10 row `layout boundary manipulation`, yaml `surfaces.native_terminal_panes`.
- **Why:** the boundary is a direct-manipulation object, so a "Resize panes" button would be chrome on the one canvas the app keeps chrome-free, and an invisible boundary is undiscoverable without a resting grip. Rejected: keyboard-only resize (it already existed and nobody found it) and per-pointermove commits (SIGWINCH storm repainting every TUI).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `NativePaneDividers.tsx`, `TaskTerminal.tsx`, `split-tree.ts (getSplitBoundaries)`, `rpc-handlers/task-panes.ts (setSplitRatio)`.

## 2026-07-31 — An agent request keeps one identity, but borrows its severity from the action

- **Rule:** Every agent-initiated request wears the same identity (accent border, AI-agent-request badge, autofocused decline) while the accepting button takes its role from what the action does — `destructive` for completion, `primary` for a launch; a request needing more than yes/no gets its own modal and `confirm()` stays boolean. Bible §6 row `agent_request`, yaml `surfaces.modal.agent_request`.
- **Why:** the 2026-06-10 completion rule bundled identity and severity, so a second instance (an agent asking to *start* a task, which is reversible and creates state) would have shipped a red button for a safe action and spent the danger token on nothing. Rejected: extending `confirm()` to host the agent picker — that turns a boolean service into a form host.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `AgentLaunchRequestModal.tsx`, `TaskDialogSubjectCard.tsx`, `confirm.tsx`, `agent-requests.ts`, `cli-socket-server.ts`. Extends the 2026-06-10 entry.

## 2026-07-30 — Capacity telemetry is permanent header chrome; faults are not

- **Rule:** Host-machine capacity (memory headroom) gets **one** permanent global-header readout at every width — framed as headroom *left*, coloured by the OS's own pressure verdict — plus a non-blocking banner at the launch decision point. Capped at one; a second ambient readout folds into the narrow sheet. Bible §5, §10 row `ambient resource telemetry`, §12.6.
- **Why:** §5.5 doctrine keeps *faults* (transport health, diagnostics) as conditional chrome so the happy path stays clean, and that reads as forbidding this widget — but capacity is a continuous decision input: the user learns *normal* only by seeing it while nothing is wrong, and needs it with zero tasks running. Same class as the always-on prevent-sleep toggle, not an error indicator. Rejected: a pressure-only conditional pill (too late to inform a launch), folding it into the narrow kebab (kills the signal exactly when screen is scarce and load is high), and colouring by an invented percentage threshold (meaningless across 8 GB and 512 GB machines).
- **Status:** Proposed. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `PreventSleepToggle.tsx` (`--awake` precedent), `BottomSheet.tsx`, `SiblingPopover.tsx` (popover row → navigate precedent).

## 2026-07-30 — Hibernated is a card state, not a column or a card action
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/31/task-hibernation-property-not-runtime-phase.md`.

## 2026-07-30 — A global default's rare per-object override lives in that object's detail modal

- **Rule:** a durable machine-local preference lives in Global Settings (bible §10 `configuration`); its rare per-object exception lives in the object's **detail modal** as a low-emphasis segmented control — never on the board, a toolbar/header, the create modal, or live object chrome. An unavailable choice stays visible, `disabled`, with its reason in `--warning` text next to it. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/global-settings/TerminalBackendSetting.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/TaskTerminalBackendRow.tsx`.
- **Why:** the terminal-backend rollout needed both a fleet-wide default and a one-task escape hatch; the modal already allows `focused_config`, so the exception rides an existing surface instead of adding toolbar buttons (the project's top anti-pattern). Rejected: a board card affordance and a Create Task field — both would advertise a rare expert switch on the happy path.

## 2026-07-30 — Find-in-content follows the content, not the viewer header

- **Rule:** `⌘F` over a viewer's rendered content puts the search UI in that surface's *content* toolbar where one exists (diff viewer §5.3), otherwise on a floating top-right bar over the content, focus-gated to that viewer; the header may carry **exactly one** magnifier icon that toggles that bar and nothing else. Bible §10 row `find in content`.
- **Why:** the two live precedents disagreed (diff viewer = toolbar toggle, terminal = floating keyboard-only bar), and the artifact header is artifact-level chrome already at 8 slots — so the search *field* stays out of it while one icon is an accepted §11 exception (user-requested: a keyboard-only find is invisible to a pointer user). Rejected: a search input in the header, and multiple entry points per viewer.
- **Status:** Observed (artifact viewer). Evidence: `TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `ArtifactSearchBar.tsx`, `TerminalSearchBar.tsx`, `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `utils/artifactDocument.ts`, `keymap.ts`.

## 2026-07-29 — Artifact bundles separate authoring from the stable shell

- **Rule:** A task artifact is an HTML entrypoint plus explicit local CSS/classic-JS/raster assets; agents normally edit only `index.html` and `report.js`, while the opaque-origin iframe sandbox provides isolation and CSP stays permissive for artifact runtimes.
- **Why:** The single 800-line file forced agents to consume formatting code for content-only work; restrictive per-capability CSP repeatedly broke legitimate local and CDN assets without strengthening the sandbox boundary.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `shared-artifacts.ts`, `artifactDocument.ts`, `artifact-template/AUTHORING.md`, decision 179. Supersedes the 2026-07-09 entry's security/export details.

## 2026-07-28 — A lifecycle split-control counts as ONE task-card inline action

- **Rule:** The card's status control may carry a second half that commits the pipeline's own terminal move (today: a ✓ straight to Completed) and still spends one slot of the §9 `max_inline_actions: 2` budget — but only when it is glued to the status trigger, shares its hover surface, is desktop-only (the narrow path stays the BottomSheet's promoted Completed row, ≥44px), and hides whenever `getAllowedTransitions` forbids the target. Anything not on the object's own lifecycle is a normal action and costs its own slot.
- **Why:** Completing was two clicks on the densest surface, and a standalone card button is exactly the toolbar-button-creep the budget exists to stop; scoping the exception to the control's own lifecycle move keeps it from becoming the loophole. A duplicate "Complete task" CTA under the menu was rejected — the Completed row is promoted (success role + ✓) instead of doubled. Confirmation is unchanged: `moveTaskToStatus` → `confirmTaskCompletion`.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `PipelineRing.tsx`, `PipelineDropdown.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, bible §9/§11.

## 2026-07-25 — Transport health is a docked pill + per-screen fetch states, not a banner

- **Rule:** While the remote transport is unhealthy, a conditional pill in the bottom-left `StatusDock` names the state and *is* the retry, then confirms recovery for ~2.5s; every transport-fed screen owes a delayed skeleton, a retry panel, and a self-heal refetch on reconnect (cached data always wins).
- **Why:** Post-boot the app read as frozen — `BootstrapScreen` only covers launch, so a dropped socket left a stale board and silently queued actions for the 120s RPC timeout. A header dot/banner was rejected (permanent chrome + layout shift on phones), a toast too (transient signal for a persisting condition). Bible §5.5 + §10.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `StatusDock.tsx`, `ConnectionStatusPill.tsx`, `ProjectView.tsx`, `KanbanBoardSkeleton.tsx`, `BoardLoadFailed.tsx`.

## 2026-07-25 — A read-only terminal viewer says so, in an earned strip above the canvas
- **Rule:** A native task terminal shared by several viewers (desktop window + remote tabs) gives exactly one of them the write lease; an observer gets a slim NON-overlapping strip directly above the canvas naming the read-only state plus a `Take control` button (secondary, bordered), and that strip flashes `da — bible §5.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/26/native-terminal-remote-viewer-bridge.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Inspector bars adapt to the PANEL's width, not the viewport's
- **Rule:** A toolbar that shares the viewport with another surface gates its label/fold behaviour on its own container width (`useContainerWidth`, ResizeObserver), not on `useCompact`/`useNarrowViewport`; and every bar is boxed (`min-w-0 overflow-hidden`) so it can never paint over a neighbour or the pinned ch — bible §5.1/§12.1.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/25/inspector-bars-adapt-to-panel-width.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Streamer mode: privacy masking is a CSS class contract
- **Rule:** Identity-bearing display values (emails, account labels, orgs, home-dir paths, tunnel URLs, QR) must carry `streamer-private`/`streamer-private-media` — bible §10.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/23/streamer-mode-css-blur-masking.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Inline-help coverage floor is a positive manifest (REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES)

- **Rule:** `help.ts` exports `REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES`, the curated list of canonical §5 surfaces/sections; `help.test.ts` asserts each resolves to a topic AND mounts a reachable zone, in addition to the existing dangling/orphan checks. Closing the pre-doctrine backlog wired ~20 new topics (viewers, config modals, project-settings tabs, two settings sub-sections, diff files/PR-conversation, inspector notes/metadata).
- **Why:** The dangling/orphan checks only police *referenced* ids, so a surface with no help id at all was invisible — many pre-§5.4 surfaces carried zero help and read as "fine". A positive floor makes "help is owed" enforceable (keymap.ts-style lockstep). Rejected: a permanent (i) per field (creep — help mode covers dense/headerless zones) and enumerating every sub-zone (floor tracks surfaces, not sub-zones).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `help.ts` (`REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES`), `__tests__/help.test.ts`, bible §5.4 (coverage floor), yaml `surfaces.inline_help.doctrine.coverage_floor`.

## 2026-07-20 — Active-tasks split is gated by viewport width, not browser mode

- **Rule:** The task workspace shows the standard `SplitLayout` + `ActiveTasksSidebar` on wide viewports (≥768px) in **both** desktop and remote/browser mode; only narrow (<768px, mobile) viewports drop it for a full-width terminal.
- **Why:** The 2026-07-19 strip removal over-reached — folding all browser mode into the narrow branch also hid the sidebar on wide remote screens, where there is ample room for it (`SplitLayout` only breaks ~<600px). The persistent `ActiveTasksStrip` stays gone; this only restores the sidebar for wide browsers.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ProjectView.tsx` (`isNarrow`-only gate), `useNarrowViewport.ts`.

## 2026-07-19 — Remove the persistent browser active-task strip

- **Rule:** Browser task workspaces keep the terminal full-width without a persistent `ActiveTasksStrip`; task switching uses the existing task-switcher overlay and breadcrumb → board navigation.
- **Why:** The strip consumed vertical space and exposed a distracting horizontal scrollbar without being the canonical task-switching surface. Rejected replacing it with another permanent row; existing task-switching surfaces already cover the workflow.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ProjectView.tsx`, `TaskSwitcherOverlay.tsx`, `MobileBoardCarousel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-19 — GitHub PR review layer in the diff viewer is read-only

- **Rule:** The diff viewer renders the task PR's review threads + top-level conversation read-only (inline via the local-comment widget mechanism, branch mode only; one "Conversation (N)" control strip at the top of the stream); every item links out to GitHub; per-thread `Send to agent` / opt-in XML export with an origin marker. **No GitHub writes from this surface — no reply/resolve/authoring.**
- **Why:** Writing reviews from dev3 duplicates GitHub's own UI and adds auth/consistency risk for near-zero gain (grilling task 0fa9144c); the agent loop — not commenting — is the product's value. Rejected: reply/resolve buttons proxying `gh`.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `ux-architecture.yaml (github_review_layer)`.

## 2026-07-17 — Help coverage is owed; help mode is the master surface (correlation invariant)

- **Rule:** Every user-facing surface/section and every non-self-evident form field MUST have a `help.ts` topic reachable in help mode (`field.*` namespace), shipped in the same commit as the UI; every registry-backed `HelpSpot` auto-renders `data-help-id`, so inline help is always a subset of the (?) overlay; dangling ids and orphan topics are forbidden and `help.test.ts` guards both directions.
- **Why:** The product has no tutorials — the UI is the only channel to convey author intent, so coverage cannot be "earned" like tips; the HelpSpot/zone sets had already drifted silently (dangling `header.rateLimits` zone; the 2026-07-16 settings re-org killed help for three categories unnoticed). Rejected: a permanent (i) per form field (chrome creep — help mode lights registered fields instead, zero permanent chrome).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §5.4 (coverage law + correlation invariant), yaml `surfaces.inline_help.doctrine`, `HelpSpot.tsx`, `__tests__/help.test.ts`.

## 2026-07-16 — Global Settings category navigation and registry
- **Rule:** Global Settings uses seven left-nav **Settings categories** with one detail pane, localized title/description search, and a narrow list→detail drill-down with an in-app back affordance.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/16/global-settings-registry.md`.

## 2026-07-15 — Mobile devices are portrait-only

- **Rule:** `useMobile()` devices attempt a portrait Screen Orientation lock; when the browser rejects it, `MobilePortraitGate` blocks the root shell in landscape with a localized rotate prompt and inert underlying content. Narrowed desktop windows stay unchanged.
- **Why:** The landscape desktop toolbar is not functional on phones, while the lock API is limited and commonly requires fullscreen. A blocking fallback preserves a usable portrait UI; a settings toggle or rotated desktop layout would add configuration and complexity.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `MobilePortraitGate.tsx`, `usePortraitOrientation.ts`, bible §12.1/§12.3.

## 2026-07-13 — Terminal immersive fullscreen is app-only and ephemeral

- **Rule:** The TaskInfoPanel fullscreen toggle plus F11 / Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F enters a task-bound renderer view with only a thin `dev3` strip and a wide neutral Exit full screen button; agent-facing notifications and viewer events queue during immersive fullscreen or persistent Focus Mode and flush when the active mode ends, with notification clicks exiting immersive fullscreen before normal task navigation.
- **Why:** Keeping the existing Route and tmux session preserves the user's exact layout and makes the feature identical in desktop and browser mode. Rejected native/browser fullscreen and tmux `resize-pane -Z` because they either diverge by transport or overwrite user-controlled pane state.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `App.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `keymap.ts`, `webNotification.ts`.

## 2026-07-13 — "Recent commits" diff mode is a split-button, N not persisted
- **Rule:** A 4th diff mode `recent` joins the diff-viewer segmented control (peer to branch/uncommitted/unpushed): a split-button whose body activates `HEAD~N..HEAD` (committed-only, clamped to the branch's own commits via the local `origin/base` merge-base — no origin fetch) and whose `▾` caret opens a fixed — bible §5.3.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/13/recent-commits-diff-mode.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Variant switching: capped clickable dots, inspector switcher, ⇧⌘[/] cycle

- **Rule:** One sibling affordance on both card surfaces — max 3 clickable status dots (self ring-highlighted + lowest variantIndexes, NO `+N` counter) opening an upgraded `SiblingPopover` (current-variant marker + per-variant titles); the inspector Context bar leads with a conditional segmented variant switcher (alive variants only, one composite control); `⇧⌘[`/`⇧⌘]` cycles alive variants (`keymap.ts`).
- **Why:** Per-variant cards stay honest to sidebar readiness tiers and diverged titles; the grilling (task seq 1042) rejected collapsing a group into one card and epic-style click-to-filter chips — the proven kanban dots+popover mechanic gets unified across surfaces and bounded instead.
- **Status:** Agreed, implementation pending. Rules: bible §5.1 + surface table + glossary; yaml `variant-switching-affordances` + `surfaces.task_card.variant_dots`.

## 2026-07-12 — PR Review always belongs in NEEDS YOU
- **Rule:** Every `review-by-colleague` task stays in the sidebar's top NEEDS YOU tier and the `is:attention` filter, regardless of its live bell count.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/12/pr-review-needs-you-tier.md`.

## 2026-07-11 — Scheduled agent message ("Send later")
- **Rule:** A one-shot text queued to a task's **live agent** (deliver at a wall-clock time / after a delay; type + Enter) is a **session action** — bible §5.1.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/11/scheduled-agent-message.md`.

## 2026-07-11 — Favorites: leading "Favorites" column on the launch picker (NOT a chip row / split)
- **Rule:** The Provider→Model→Mode picker (`AgentConfigPicker`) carries ONE compact favorites control as a **leading labeled column** (peer to Provider/Model/Mode) on the 3 **launch** surfaces (Launch/Retry, Spawn Agent, Bug Hunters) via `showFavorites`: a narrow fixed-width trigger with a Nerd Font **star tha — bible §10.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/11/agent-favorites.md`.

## 2026-07-10 — Token-DSL task filters: search string is the single source of truth
- **Rule:** Structured filtering on the board and sidebar is a token DSL (`priority:` `label:` `agent:` `status:` `is:attention` `has:port`) living inside the *one* search string; a shared `FilterFunnel` dropdown (grouped PRIORITY/STATUS/LABELS/AGENTS/FLAGS, PRIORITY first, values-in-pool only, empty groups hid — bible §5.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/10/token-dsl-task-filters.md`.

## 2026-07-10 — Diagnostics: in-UI crash/error surface for remote/mobile

- **Rule:** One framework-agnostic diagnostics store feeds three surfaces — a provider-wrapping `RootErrorBoundary` (self-contained English fallback), a phase+timeout `BootstrapScreen` (Retry/Reload replaces the bare spinner), and a `DiagnosticsPanel` opened from a floating pill that appears ONLY in remote mode when `errorCount > 0` (plus a pre-React loader in `index.html`).
- **Why:** Mobile/remote users have no devtools; crashes blanked the page and stuck loads spun silently. Rejected a permanent header/menu diagnostics button (button-creep, and dead on a crashed tree) and an external error reporter (doesn't let the user see/copy it on the phone). The pill is earned, not permanent.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `diagnostics.ts`, `RootErrorBoundary.tsx`, `BootstrapScreen.tsx`, `DiagnosticsPanel.tsx`, `DiagnosticsIndicator.tsx`; bible §5.5.

## 2026-07-09 — HTML Artifacts: sandboxed task workspace + separate Runtime control

- Placement and Runtime-control rules remain in bible §5; the security/export contract is superseded by the 2026-07-29 artifact-bundle decision.

## 2026-07-06 — Feature-gated preset: shown-but-disabled + deep-link to enable
- **Rule:** a preset that depends on an off-by-default capability (e.g — bible §10.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/06/pxpipe-cost-trick-preset.md`.

## 2026-07-05 — Automations: project-settings tab; runs are ordinary tasks

- **Rule:** The `Automation` object (RRULE+tz schedule + prompt + agent, per project) is durable configuration → CRUD lives in a 4th `ProjectSettings` tab (tabs 3→4, budget ≤6); each fire creates a **normal task** on the board (clock-glyph provenance on the card); run history + missed-run status render only inside the tab; failures/missed runs surface via toast + status, never silently.
- **Why:** configuration-in-settings rule + nav budget ≤7. Rejected: a top-level "Automations" destination (a single-feature screen violates the nav budget) and a board-level panel (durable config on an operational surface).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: bible §3 (Automation), yaml `objects.automation`, `ProjectSettings.tsx`, `automations-scheduler.ts`.

## 2026-07-05 — Agent rate-limit indicator is ambient header status, not a cockpit metric

- **Rule:** account-wide agent rate-limit usage renders as a passive icon+percent indicator in the global header's stateful-indicators zone (next to prevent-sleep); hidden until data exists, `warning` token ≥80%, `danger` ≥95%; its enable toggle lives in Global Settings → Agents (`rate-limit-tracking` entry, `settings-registry.ts`).
- **Why:** it is a diagnostic "battery gauge" the user must see before hitting a limit — not a motivational countable signal (cockpit rejected) and not task-scoped (task surfaces rejected).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `ux-architecture.yaml` global_header.allowed.
## 2026-07-03 — Inline help: one registry, three layers (Tooltip / HelpSpot / help mode)

- **Rule:** Help content lives in a `src/mainview/help.ts` registry (declare-as-data, like `keymap.ts`/`tips.ts`); a fast `Tooltip` primitive progressively replaces native `title=` on icon controls; a ghost (i) `HelpSpot` → rich read-only `HelpCard` is allowed only in header-bearing sections (≤1 each); dense headerless zones (inspector quickbars, task card) are covered by a screen-wide help-mode overlay (`⇧⌘/`, Help menu, palette, kebab on narrow) via `data-help-id` — never by permanent icons. Bible §5.4.
- **Why:** Native `title=` (~227 usages) is slow and control-scoped, and per-section (i) icons everywhere would be toolbar-button-creep wearing a help hat. Rejected: (i) in every zone (creep); help-mode-only (no ambient discoverability); tooltip-migration-only (explains buttons, not sections).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: bible §5.4, yaml `surfaces.inline_help`, `help.ts`, `Tooltip.tsx`, `HelpSpot.tsx`, `HelpCard.tsx`, `HelpOverlay.tsx`.

## 2026-07-03 — Close Pane: two-step visual pane picker (no new button; destructive gets spatial friction)

- **Rule:** The red Close Pane control (inspector `tmux_controls` + native menu) no longer blind-kills the active pane — it arms a transient overlay over the terminal that draws one hit-box per pane from real tmux geometry (cells → %, PaneMapSheet math); hover arms a pane in `danger` red (idle = neutral `accent` marching-ants), click kills exactly it, Esc / scrim cancels, last-pane kill routes through the `confirm()` service. Narrow/touch keeps the old direct-kill (no hover). No new toolbar button.
- **Why:** Blind-kill closed the wrong pane and gave a destructive action zero friction; a spatial two-step pick supplies the friction + `destructive` token + confirmation the rubric wants while adding zero chrome (avoids toolbar-button-creep, the #1 anti-pattern) and reusing the mini-map geometry. Rejected: a dropdown pane list (loses the on-screen spatial mapping); a persistent per-pane close affordance (control creep). Decision 101.
- **Status:** Observed (verified in-browser). Evidence: `ClosePanePicker.tsx`, `close-pane-picker.ts`, `rpc-handlers/tmux-pty.ts` (tmuxKillPane), `TaskTmuxControls.tsx`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-07-03 — Agent picker: Provider → Model → Mode cascade (UI-only grouping, flat `configId` stays the key)

- **Rule:** The launch picker's 3-field cascade is a presentation grouping over the existing flat preset list — the selected leaf resolves to a single `configId`, which stays the durable storage key and command-resolution unit; no data-model decomposition, no migration. Optional `groupLabel?`/`modeLabel?` on `AgentConfiguration` override derivation only when curation beats it. Changing Model preserves the current Mode kind when it exists in the new group (bible §1.0).
- **Why:** Provider matrices are irregular and curated (Codex encodes effort×sandbox in `additionalArgs`, OpenCode's 2nd axis is a persona) — a decomposed `model × mode` cross-product would generate invalid combos, lose per-preset curation, and force a `configId` migration across app versions sharing `~/.dev3.0/` (frozen-layout risk). Rejected: data-model decomposition; optgroup subheaders in one long dropdown (doesn't reduce choice per step).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `LaunchVariantsModal.tsx`, `utils/agentPicker.ts`, `shared/types.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — Mobile terminal input: docked composer default + sticky raw-mode toggle

- **Rule:** On touch in browser mode (gate = `!isElectrobun && isTouchDevice`, NOT width) the terminal never summons the OSK; a docked chat-style composer owns text entry (Send = mode-2004-aware paste + Enter), with a sticky `⌨` raw toggle on `ExtraKeyBar` restoring direct typing. Bible §12.
- **Why:** OSK leaves ~4 terminal rows — compose-then-paste with the tail visible is the converged industry pattern (Termius/Blink/Happy); rejected fullscreen-compose-default (hides the agent's question) and raw-only chrome collapse (typing stays miserable).
- **Status:** Observed (shipped 2026-07-03). Evidence: `TerminalComposer.tsx`, `TerminalView.tsx`, `ExtraKeyBar.tsx`.

## 2026-07-02 — Shared-images re-open control: a Runtime-bar button, not an inspector chip

- **Rule:** Access-to-produced-output controls belong in the inspector's Runtime & access bar (row 2 right); the images button renders only when count > 0 and is a relocation, not an addition. Bible §5.1.
- **Why:** The Context-bar chip read as passive metadata and was undiscoverable; row 2 is the "Outputs" domain (open-in, dev-server) so produced screenshots belong there; rejected duplicating the control (bar creep) and an always-visible disabled button at zero.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02). Evidence: `task-info-panel/TaskSharedImages.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-02 — Task image viewer v2: windowed card, fill-to-frame, per-image captions

- **Rule:** The image viewer is a centred windowed modal card (~85vw, fullscreen one keypress away), images fill the frame, tall captures auto-switch to fill-width + vertical scroll, and each `--caption` annotates the image it follows.
- **Why:** A full-bleed takeover didn't read as task-bound and never upscaled small captures; ghostty's WebGL canvas paints above DOM scrims in the desktop shell, so the viewer hides `[data-terminal]` via `visibility:hidden` while open. Decision 097 (addendum).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02, verified in-browser). Evidence: `TaskImageViewer.tsx`, `src/cli/commands/show-image.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — `dev3 show-image` + a task-bound image viewer (new lightbox overlay surface)

- **Rule:** Agent-surfaced images open in a global lightbox overlay (Modal family, not a destination, not the inspector); arrival raises the attention badge + toast, auto-opens only when the user is already focused on that task; a conditional count badge appears next to the diff badge. Bible §5, §12.3.
- **Why:** The missing "agent shows the human a picture" channel; mirrors the diff viewer (task-scoped full surface kept out of nav to protect the ≤7 nav budget and inspector density); files stored in the task worktree (`shared-images/`, additive to the frozen `~/.dev3.0/` layout). Rejected: new destination, inspector tab, toast-only (no history). Decision 097.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02). Evidence: `src/bun/shared-images.ts`, `TaskImageViewer.tsx`, `cli-socket-server.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — Period navigation on the Velocity Cockpit (temporal nav ≠ a forbidden control)

- **Rule:** The read-only stats cockpit may gain navigation along the time axis (prev/next period stepper; offset ephemeral, lifetime views stay anchored to now) — but never data filters on new dimensions, mutations, or durable config. Bible §1.1, `stats_dashboard.allowed/forbidden`.
- **Why:** Temporal nav extends the existing time-range switch on the same axis (no new control class); rejected a date picker (turns the celebration surface into an operator console).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `stats/PeriodStepper.tsx`, `utils/productivityStats.ts` (`offset`).

## 2026-06-29 — Dashboard Activity: narrow-viewport action sheet (corrects the "OK" verdict)

- **Rule:** On narrow viewports the dashboard project-row action cluster + reorder collapse into a kebab → `BottomSheet`; touch targets ≥44px; no feature may be touch-unreachable. Bible §12.3/§12.6.
- **Why:** Audit showed the "narrow = OK" verdict was wrong: non-wrapping icon row, ~28px targets, reorder fully touch-dead (HTML5 drag + `hidden md:flex` steps); the doctrine's kebab→sheet fixes all three with zero desktop change.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-29). Evidence: `ActivityOverview.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Narrow-viewport tmux windows switcher (pairs with the panes switcher)

- **Rule:** Sub-768px terminals get a windows switcher bar above the panes bar (buttons + dropdown, NO swipe — the pane carousel owns horizontal swipe on that surface), shown only when window count > 1.
- **Why:** Windows were the one terminal affordance with no mobile form (doctrine §4); reuses the panes-switcher idiom; a dedicated `tmuxWindowNavigate` RPC returns layout (same reason `tmuxPaneNavigate` exists). Decision 093.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-29). Evidence: `MobileWindowCarousel.tsx`, `rpc-handlers/tmux-pty.ts`.

## 2026-06-29 — Dev-server button states: green = running only, spinner = transient only

- **Rule:** The `success` green token means a *running* dev server only (configured-but-stopped = neutral); spinners are reserved for transient start/restart; a healthy long-running process shows a calm pulsing dot. Bible §7, §5.1.
- **Why:** The button painted green for any task with a dev script, misusing the token; a perpetual spinner reads as "stuck loading" — the pulsing-dot idiom already used by `BugHuntersLightbox` signals "alive" without anxiety.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped in #754). Evidence: `task-info-panel/TaskDevServer.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Alt/Option-click moves the shell cursor (terminal expert gesture, no chrome)

- **Rule:** Expert pointer gestures layered on the terminal surface add zero chrome (no keymap entry, no menu/setting — a tip is the only discoverability); the shell-vs-TUI decision must live on the backend (tmux `pane_current_command`), never on renderer mouse-tracking state.
- **Why:** dev3's tmux runs `mouse on`, so SGR tracking is always on and the renderer can't distinguish a shell from vim/htop; backend gating keeps the gesture inert in mouse-owning TUIs. Decision 098.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/bun/tmux-alt-click.ts`, `TerminalView.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Instrument & celebrate: countable progress feeds the Velocity Cockpit (standing rule)

- **Rule:** New features producing countable, repeatable signals should emit them into the stats pipeline at build time and surface a cockpit visualization when motivational; the cockpit stays read-only, honest (no backfill, no inflation), and diagnostic metrics stay off it. Bible §1.1, `placement_rules.instrument-and-surface-countable-metrics`.
- **Why:** The cockpit compounds value only if features feed it by default; guardrails (read-only, complexity+honesty budget) prevent it becoming a bloat license.
- **Status:** Proposed (standing practice; cockpit itself Observed).

## 2026-06-28 — Productivity Stats "flair" pass: animations, heatmap, milestones, momentum headline

- **Rule:** The stats showcase may gain motivational polish (boot animations gated by `useReducedMotion`, a range-independent 12-month heatmap, lifetime milestone medals, a momentum headline) but zero new controls; achievement semantics get their own tokens (`--stat-gold`, `--stat-fire`) rather than overloading accent/danger.
- **Why:** Vanity surface — "feel alive and rewarding" is on-brief; a "this week" heatmap is meaningless so the year grid stays range-independent; verifiable logic lives in the pure engine.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-28). Evidence: `utils/productivityStats.ts`, `components/stats/*`.

## 2026-06-28 — Productivity Stats is a new top-level destination, entered from the Dashboard

- **Rule:** A read-only stats screen is a genuine durable place → earns a top-level destination (nav budget stays ≤7); entry via Dashboard card + View menu + ⇧⌘P — explicitly NO GlobalHeader button.
- **Why:** Serves the developer-speed positioning; the user chose the Dashboard card over header chrome; LOC is forward-only (captured at completion, decision 084) so the views show an honest "tracking since". Rejected: a panel inside the Dashboard list, a Settings home.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-28). Evidence: `ProductivityStatsView.tsx`, `rpc-handlers/productivity-stats.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — `dev3 remote` backgrounds by default (user-first CLI default)

- **Rule:** Hand-typed CLI commands default to what a lazy human wants (detach + print link + return the shell); machine/supervised callers (systemd, Docker, skills) pay the explicit `--no-detach`. Bible §1.0.
- **Why:** The Unix foreground-daemon convention optimizes for supervisors, but the primary caller here is a human; rejected keeping foreground default (taxes the human to please a convention that doesn't bind them).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/cli/commands/remote.ts`, `remote-service.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — Browser-mode application menu bar (the native menu's stand-in in Remote Access)

- **Rule:** Browser mode renders its own `AppMenuBar` above `GlobalHeader`, built from the SAME `buildApplicationMenu` source as the native menu (relocated to `src/shared/`) — one definition, no RPC, no drift; items not covered by `menuRouter` browser handlers are dropped; labels stay English (documented exception). Never mounted in Electrobun.
- **Why:** Remote mode lost the canonical action surface; a fresh top strip adds zero pressure to the dense header cluster; rejected merging into `GlobalHeader`, a `getApplicationMenu` RPC, and duplicating the menu (guaranteed drift).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/shared/application-menu.ts`, `AppMenuBar.tsx`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — Narrow-viewport (mobile) doctrine: carousel/one-at-a-time everywhere

- **Rule:** On sub-768px show exactly one sibling at a time with swipe + visible pager; gate layout on reactive `useNarrowViewport(768)` (never `isElectrobun`, never mount-once `useMobile`); full-surface swipe only on scroll-body surfaces (never live-content like terminals/diffs); every swipe has button+keyboard equivalents; `BottomSheet` is the mandated mobile action surface; no feature may be touch-unreachable. Bible §12 + yaml `responsive`.
- **Why:** Phone-over-remote is the real secondary form factor; generalising the proven board carousel avoids forking a separate mobile app; the breakpoint reconciliation fixed a real 1024-vs-768 doc/code mismatch.
- **Status:** Observed (board + terminal + header + inspector shipped; rest tracked per-surface in yaml `surface_adaptation`).

## 2026-06-28 — Remote Access modal: network-interface (IP) selector, tunnel-off only

- **Rule:** When the tunnel is off, a styled native `<select>` above the URL block lists candidate IPv4s (+ loopback) and rebuilds URL/QR; hidden when the tunnel is on; requested host validated against the enumerated allow-list; session-local.
- **Why:** Auto-picking one interface breaks on multi-homed boxes (VPN/Docker/multiple NICs) and blocks the SSH-forward `localhost` path; configuration inside an existing modal = no new surface; native `<select>` reuses the `ProjectSettings` pattern and is not a banned OS dialog.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `remote-access-server.ts`, `rpc-handlers/remote-access.ts` (`host` param).

## 2026-06-27 — Global keyboard focus ring (`:focus-visible`) as the single focus affordance

- **Rule:** One global `:focus-visible` accent outline in `index.css` (keyboard/AT only, never mouse), authored after `@tailwind utilities`; modal shells (`[tabindex="-1"]`) exempted. **Specificity trap: `focus:outline-none` is banned.** Tailwind compiles it to `.focus\:outline-none:focus` at specificity (0,2,0), which beats the global `:focus-visible` rule at (0,1,0) regardless of source order and silently kills the keyboard ring. Bare `outline-none` (0,1,0) is fine — it loses on source order.
- **Why:** App-wide ring belongs in the base stylesheet; the `focus:outline-none` trap was identified as a shipped regression vector (see §9a.1). Rejected: per-component Tailwind ring classes; a new focus token (accent already is the focus color).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-27). Evidence: `src/mainview/index.css`, `DESIGN.md`.

## 2026-06-24 — Built-in Operations board: pinned-first, ⌘0, and a "system object" identity

- **Rule:** The built-in Operations board (`kind: "virtual"` + `builtin: true`) is pinned first everywhere (`orderProjectsForDisplay`), owns `⌘0` (excluded from ⌘1-9; zoom-reset moved to ⇧⌘0), and reads as a system object (bracketed localized name + ⚡ + SYSTEM badge) — no new object, destination, or color token.
- **Why:** Structurally special (app-provisioned, undeletable) so it must not read as "just another project"; bracketed-name treatment chosen over a new violet token to avoid theme churn; virtual tasks drop Git/Dev-Server/Scripts inspector controls (net budget reduction).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-24). Evidence: `shared/types.ts` (`isBuiltinOpsProject`), `App.tsx`, `ActivityOverview.tsx`.

## 2026-06-23 — Virtual "Operations" board: repo-less ad-hoc work as `Project.kind: "virtual"`

- **Rule:** Repo-less work is a new *kind* of the existing Project object — same dashboard/board/cards/labels stack, git domain hidden entirely, simplified columns; virtual projects live in a separate `~/.dev3.0/virtual-projects.json` (parallel-path rule 5) with synthetic never-reused `~/.dev3.0/ops/<slug>` paths so `projectSlug()`/CLI context stay untouched; working dir is a managed temp folder by default.
- **Why:** A new kind keeps IA/nav/components unchanged while switching git off where meaningless; rejected a new top-level nav entry, a parallel Workspace object (~90% overlap), and a no-worktree flag inside git projects (breaks diff/PR semantics). Directory hidden by default to kill the onboarding problem.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped 2026-06-23 in 6 stages; replaced `home-terminal`, ⇧⌘` = Quick-shell operation). Full spec in git history.

## 2026-06-22 — Feature-discovery tips are surface-aware and distributed beyond the board

- **Rule:** Tips carry a required `contexts` field used as a sort *boost, never a filter* (matching tips lead, then the full catalogue cycles); the `ActiveTasksSidebar` is the tip carrier for the task/terminal view via the shared `useTipRotation` hook.
- **Why:** Tips previously reached only the Kanban board, so terminal-surface discovery facts never reached terminal dwellers; boost-not-filter keeps every surface cycling everything. Rejected: a ticker (annoying), a permanent terminal footer (chrome creep), an exclusive-context flag.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `tips.ts` (`TipContext`), `hooks/useTipRotation.ts`.

## 2026-07-11 — Active Tasks sidebar: readiness tiers + visible priority (supersedes 2026-06-22)
- **Rule:** The sidebar groups by **readiness tier** — `NEEDS YOU` (review-by-user ∪ user-questions ∪ *signalled* review-by-colleague) → custom columns (project order) → `WAITING` (in-progress ∪ review-by-ai ∪ unsignalled review-by-colleague) — not by status; within every tier it sorts by priority band P0→P4, t.
- **Why:** `decisions/2026/07/11/sidebar-readiness-tiers.md`.

## 2026-06-21 — Hint navigation is a cross-surface primitive; keyboard-first expert layer

- **Rule:** The Vimium-style `HintOverlay` is surface-agnostic (scans `[data-hint-id]` on the innermost clickable element); hints map to navigation/open destinations only — never mutations or destructive actions; bare/sequence keys match on `e.code` (layout-independent).
- **Why:** Generalizing the existing overlay avoids per-surface clones; `e.key` matching made the feature Latin-layout-only (the real bug); `g`-prefix go-to + `/` + `c` follow Linear/GitHub conventions. Decision 076.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `HintOverlay.tsx`, `utils/hintLabels.ts`, `App.tsx`.

## 2026-06-19 — Diff review is a 3-day persisted safety net + explicit "Reset review"

- **Rule:** Inline diff reviews persist in `localStorage` with a 3-day TTL (safety net, not a store); clipboard is transport only; `Reset review` is destructive-styled, confirm-gated, visible only with ≥1 comment; the whole review lifecycle stays inside the diff viewer surface (documented as bible §5.2).
- **Why:** Reviews previously lived in volatile clipboard + React state and were lost to accidental terminal selections; permanent storage was over-scoped (stale accumulation) — 3 days covers the realistic re-copy window; a backend file store rejected (RPC plumbing + touching the frozen `~/.dev3.0/` zone for ephemeral drafts).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (`pruneExpiredReviews`).

## 2026-06-19 — Keyboard-shortcut registry as single source of truth + two-tab reference overlay

- **Rule:** `src/mainview/keymap.ts` is the single source of truth for app-level shortcuts (drives the two-tab App|Terminal `KeyboardShortcutsModal`, README, website); the registry documents — the `App.tsx` handler chain stays the dispatcher; entry via Help menu + ⌘/ + palette, never a toolbar button or nav destination.
- **Why:** Registry-driven dispatch was rejected as a risky rewrite of edge-case-heavy central code (capture phase, terminal focus, `e.code`); a vitest test guards drift instead; ⌘/ over bare `?` because the live terminal must still receive `?`.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped; also codified in AGENTS.md). Evidence: `keymap.ts`, `KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`, `__tests__/keymap.test.ts`.

## 2026-06-19 — Both palettes surfaced in the native View menu (discoverability)

- **Rule:** Keyboard-only surfaces still get native-menu entries (the menu is the canonical action surface); chord accelerators can't be bound in Electrobun (single-char only, decision 044) so the chord is shown in the label text and the keydown handlers stay the sole shortcut owners.
- **Why:** A native accelerator would double-fire against the toggle handlers. Decision 074.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `application-menu.ts`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-06-18 — Action palette (⇧⌘P): two-surfaces-one-shell; DOM mirror of the native menu

- **Rule:** Navigation (⌘K) and actions (⇧⌘P) are two surfaces on one extracted `PaletteShell`; the action palette runs commands via the existing `handleMenuAction` router (a mirror, not a second command runner); destructive lifecycle + modal flows are excluded by policy (destructive needs friction, not fuzzy-Enter); language-switch labels stay identical across locales so English is always findable.
- **Why:** VSCode's chord convention; routing through `handleMenuAction` also fixed several previously-inert native menu items. Decision 072.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `CommandPaletteModal.tsx`, `commands.ts`, `PaletteShell.tsx`.

## 2026-06-18 — Command palette (⌘K) introduced as a new surface

- **Rule:** ⌘K is the type-to-find navigation surface (keyboard-only, zero visible chrome — no toolbar-creep); short UI entities must reuse `utils/fuzzyMatch.ts` as the single matcher (BM25 stays for long transcripts only); ⌘K = navigation, ⇧⌘P = actions, kept separate.
- **Why:** `Cmd+T` rejected — universal "new tab" and intercepted by the live terminal; ⌘K is the Slack/Linear/Notion convention. Distinct from the Option+Tab switcher (MRU over *active* tasks vs type-search over all entities).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `ProjectQuickSwitchModal.tsx`, `utils/fuzzyMatch.ts`.

## 2026-06-15 — Option+Tab task switcher is a transient HUD overlay, NOT a command palette

- **Rule:** The task switcher is an `expert_shortcut` rendering the existing `task_jump` action class as a hold-cycle HUD (Option+Tab project / Option+Shift+Tab global; Ctrl+Tab on Linux); MRU in-memory order; live Shift scope toggle; commit respects `dev3-task-open-mode`.
- **Why:** A command palette was rejected — the sidebar already owns `task_jump` and a new global palette would be surface creep; MRU matches the alt-tab muscle memory the user explicitly invoked. Decision 069.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskSwitcherOverlay.tsx`.

## 2026-06-16 — Browser-style back/forward navigation in the global header

- **Rule:** History arrows live at the far LEFT of the header breadcrumb row (navigation belongs with the "address bar", not the action cluster), as a segmented pill of two icon-only chevrons; ⌘[/⌘] + mouse side buttons drive the existing `state.ts` route-history stack.
- **Why:** Bare chevrons didn't read as a control (looked decorative); the segmented group is the universal back/forward affordance; far-left placement adds zero pressure to the dense right cluster. History dropdown rejected as scope creep.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `state.ts`.

## 2026-06-15 — Compact status-age badge on Active Tasks sidebar cards

- **Rule:** Status-age is a read-only `status` indicator (consumes no action budget): clock glyph + single most-significant unit (`5m`/`7h`/`13d`), live 1s re-render, verbose form in the tooltip only.
- **Why:** `movedAt` is written only on real status changes so it faithfully means "time in current status"; compact-only per the user's requirement.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `utils/statusAge.ts`, `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`.

## 2026-06-15 — Cmd+Shift+1..9 switches project to the OPPOSITE view

- **Rule:** Shift = inverse of the unshifted chord: ⌘1-9 preserves view mode, ⇧⌘1-9 flips it (and deliberately ignores `dev3-task-open-mode` — explicit Shift means "the other view"). Not in the app menu (chord accelerators impossible, decision 044).
- **Why:** One-chord "reach a project AND the other layout"; macOS swallows ⇧⌘3/4/5 for screenshots — documented, not worked around. Decision 068.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `App.tsx`.

## 2026-06-12 — Quiet "behind origin" indicator on the header Git Pull button

- **Rule:** Header convention: *quiet* accent (icon tint + 6px dot) for ambient "something is available"; *loud* accent (filled pill + pulse) reserved for app-update prompts. Status indicators don't consume the header action budget.
- **Why:** Behind-origin is a status, not an action; backend `fetchOrigin` is throttled (3 min) so the 15s poll stays network-free.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `GitPullButton.tsx`, `git.ts` (`getBehindOriginCount`).

## 2026-06-11 — Slash skill autocomplete in the new-task description

- **Rule:** Input assists (inline autocomplete anchored to the field) are zero-chrome and consume no surface budget; a dedicated "insert X" button would be toolbar creep.
- **Why:** Users invoke skills by `/name` and shouldn't memorize slugs; caret-anchored positioning rejected as needless complexity for a 4-row textarea.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `useSkillAutocomplete.ts`, `SkillAutocompleteDropdown.tsx`, `src/bun/skills-catalog.ts`.

## 2026-06-10 — AI-initiated task completion uses a blocking, visually distinct confirm dialog

- **Rule:** Agent-requested completion opens the imperative `confirm()` modal with an `agentInitiated` treatment (accent border + "AI agent request" badge, danger-role confirm, autofocused cancel); the CLI blocks ≤10 min; decline = exit code 6; `cancelled` stays CLI-forbidden.
- **Why:** Completion destroys the worktree + tmux session (destructive → human approval); the AI-identity badge prevents mistaking it for a routine confirm. Zero new chrome. Decision 067.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `confirm.tsx`, `completion-requests.ts`, `cli-socket-server.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — Narrow-viewport carousel navigation (mobile / remote)

- **Rule:** Narrow viewports get a responsive *view-mode* of existing screens, never a new destination: board = 2D scroll-snap carousel (full-surface swipe OK — column bodies scroll only vertically); terminal = pane carousel with an explicit pager (NO full-pane swipe — TUIs consume touch); gate on width, not `isElectrobun`.
- **Why:** "One screen-width element + swipe to siblings" is presentation of data the screens already own (bible §4); tmux auto-unzooms on pane select so steps must `select-pane` then re-zoom. Idea by Ittai Zeidman.
- **Status:** Observed (board + pane carousels shipped). Evidence: `MobileBoardCarousel.tsx`, `MobilePaneCarousel.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — Cmd+1..9 preserves the current view mode (task-view vs board)

- **Rule:** Project switching preserves the user's view mode (task view → task view with an explicit "select a task" empty state; board → board); the empty state is a status surface (centered muted text, no button, no auto-selected task).
- **Why:** Keyboard-heavy users live in the task view; yanking to the board on every switch breaks flow; auto-selecting a task was explicitly rejected — the user asked for an empty pane, not a guess.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `App.tsx`, `ProjectView.tsx`, `state.ts` (`taskView`).

## 2026-06-03 — Prevent-sleep surfaced as a header toggle with a new `--awake` token

- **Rule:** Prevent-sleep is an always-visible header toggle (coffee glyph, semantic `--awake` amber token in both themes), forced on + locked while remote access is active; enabled = sleep inhibited whole-app-lifetime, not just while agents run.
- **Why:** Buried in Settings it was invisible; amber/coffee reads "awake" and is distinct from `--warning`; remote-active detection imported lazily to keep the resource monitor free of electrobun-heavy imports.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `PreventSleepToggle.tsx`, `caffeinate.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — TaskInfoPanel governed by a 4-bar 2×2 domain model

- **Rule:** The inspector header is a 2×2 grid of quickbars, one per domain — Context / Session-Agent (row 1 = "Drive"), Git / Runtime (row 2 = "Outputs"); panel chrome pinned far-right of row 1 is not a bar; labels truncate to 4 chips + `+k`. Bible §5.1.
- **Why:** Row-1-right had become a 4-domain dumpster; the panel has a hard `MAX_RATIO=0.33` height budget, so domains separate horizontally, not by adding rows.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — macOS dock-persistence + React quit-confirmation modal

- **Rule:** Standard macOS lifecycle (`exitOnLastWindowClosed: false`; closing windows ≠ quitting); one React quit-confirmation modal (never `showMessageBox`) driven by a single `before-quit` gate on every deliberate quit; a window-less quit reopens a window that pulls the pending dialog on mount.
- **Why:** The dialog must work identically in the remote client; the pull-on-mount handshake fixed a push-vs-mount race. Decisions 044/060/061.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `quit-manager.ts`, `App.tsx`, `src/bun/index.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — Hide-sidebar affordance inside the Active Tasks sidebar header

- **Rule:** Controls that govern a panel (chrome) sit at the panel-chrome convention's far-right edge; the sidebar header follows the toolbar budget (≤4 visible), not the §5.1 bar model.
- **Why:** The split could only be collapsed from the top-right; the sidebar needed its own affordance, mirroring the inspector's zoom toggle.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — Compact (≤1600px) layout for header + task toolbar

- **Rule:** Below 1600px (`useCompact()`), header/toolbar labels collapse to icon-only (tooltips kept) and the rare external links fold into a single `⋯` overflow; no flex-wrap (vertical space is scarce in a terminal-centric app).
- **Why:** 14" MacBooks overflowed the labelled rows; per the action taxonomy, rare external links are the correct overflow candidates. Content-aware (ResizeObserver) v2 noted. Decision 063.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `useCompact.ts`, `GlobalHeader.tsx`.

## 2026-05-29 — Toolbar button creep flagged as the primary anti-pattern

- **Rule:** Explicit complexity budgets; adding a visible button to `TaskInfoPanel`, `TaskCard`, or board toolbars requires an overflow/group decision first.
- **Why:** Changelog history showed steady accretion of always-visible git/tmux/dev-server buttons on the densest surfaces.
- **Status:** Inferred (from changelog + file sizes) — now enforced by the budgets in yaml.

## 2026-05-29 — Native application menu is the canonical action surface

- **Rule:** The Electrobun application menu is the authoritative, complete action taxonomy; DOM toolbars mirror only the frequent subset.
- **Why:** The menu enumerates every action; DOM surfaces are intentionally partial to control density.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/shared/application-menu.ts`.

## 2026-08-03 — Task card is governed by five zones, and the left rail owns lifecycle

- **Rule:** The board card is a 3px status strip + a full-width identity header + a 20px vertical lifecycle rail (44px on touch) (status control) + a body whose segmented bottom bar carries grouped signals above a reserved action strip; each zone has one admission rule (`surfaces.task_card.zone_model`).
- **Why:** Nothing was zoned, so every feature added a badge row and the status control — the most important button on the card — read as a text label; the rejected alternative was a right-hand indicator rail (constant height, but a bare counter hides severity).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskCard.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/TaskCardRail.tsx`.

## 2026-05-29 — Button variants documented as role → token, not as a prop

Folded: role → Tailwind token, no `<Button variant>` API — owned by `PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §9a and AGENTS.md's semantic-token rule.

## 2026-05-29 — Initial manifest derived from repository

Folded: screens, not URL routes (the `Route` union in `state.ts`) — owned by `ux-architecture.yaml` `routes`.
