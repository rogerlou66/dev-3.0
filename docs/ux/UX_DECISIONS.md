## 2026-08-27 — Workspace swimlanes express project priority

- **Rule:** Dashboard → Board reuses the persisted project order: drag a desktop project handle or use up/down controls to move the whole swimlane; Operations remains pinned and task dragging remains project-scoped.
- **Why:** Cross-project scanning loses its value when important projects are trapped below less urgent ones; a second Board-only ranking would make Board and Projects disagree.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `WorkspaceBoard.test.tsx`, bible §5.

## 2026-08-26 — Workspace Board opens one focused task overlay

- **Rule:** Clicking an active/preparing/recoverable task on Dashboard → Board opens one modal, non-route `WorkspaceTaskOverlay` (`92vw × 88dvh`, full-bleed narrow) over the still-mounted inert board; terminal Tab/Escape pass through, Close/Back/backdrop/Global Kanban return to the board, Open full page hands off to the route, and non-live cards keep their detail/edit flow.
- **Why:** Route navigation discarded the cross-project scan context the user was working from; a drawer squeezed the terminal, a popover could not host the full inspector/workspace, and multiple draggable windows would create a second window manager.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `WorkspaceTaskOverlay.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, bible §5/§12.

## 2026-08-23 — Android is a native shell over the computer authority

- **Rule:** Android adds a shell-level connection gateway and exact-origin native prompt dock, then reuses the existing dashboard/project/task routes and host RPC/PTY authority; tablet layout follows window width and supports landscape.
- **Why:** A WebView-only wrapper leaves IME/render contention untouched, while a full native rewrite duplicates the product IA and hundreds of evolving actions; the hybrid shell isolates the latency-critical input path without forking state.
- **Status:** Foundation implemented and APK build-verified; emulator/real-tablet QA remains. Evidence: `android/`, `src/mainview/android-client-bridge.ts`, `decisions/2026/08/23/android-hybrid-client-native-prompt-bridge.md`.

## 2026-08-21 — Workspace Board owns a terminal-safe navigation shortcut

- **Rule:** The remappable workspace-board action opens Dashboard → Board directly (default Command+Backquote on macOS), including when Projects is active; Project Terminal moves to Command+J, while Quick Shell keeps Shift+Command+Backquote.
- **Why:** Bare-key `G → D` correctly yields to terminal and input focus, so it cannot be the daily path back from coding work; a modifier shortcut remains reachable without adding visible header chrome.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `keymap.ts`, `App.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`.

## 2026-08-20 — Workspace Completed history discloses per project

- **Rule:** Each workspace Completed cell shows its two newest tasks by default; `Show N more` expands all remaining completed tasks for only that project, and `Show less` restores the compact row.
- **Why:** Completed is durable history, but rendering every archived card makes one project's swimlane dominate the daily-work matrix; deletion and a global collapse were rejected because neither matches the task's local history scope.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `WorkspaceBoard.test.tsx`.

## 2026-08-20 — Workspace search shares the dashboard tab bar

- **Rule:** Dashboard Board's one search field occupies the trailing edge of the `Board | Projects` tab bar, appears only while Board is active, and flexes narrower before it can displace either tab.
- **Why:** Search is a temporary filter of the active workspace board; a dedicated second toolbar consumed vertical space without adding a second control or a distinct scope.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `Dashboard.tsx`, `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`.

## 2026-08-19 — Treat questions as attention, not location

- **Rule:** Boards project `user-questions` into Agent is Working with an amber `Needs input` card; AI/PR review columns are contextual, terminal columns stay expanded, and Dashboard Board aligns all projects as swimlanes.
- **Why:** Persistent empty handoff columns made lifecycle scanning and cross-project work unnecessarily wide; deleting backend statuses was rejected because hooks and automation still need their semantics.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `KanbanBoard.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `types.ts#getBoardColumns`.

## 2026-08-14 — An agent-to-agent message toast names two tasks and owns its own hue

- **Rule:** The toast for `dev3 message` between two agents renders `#fromSeq title → #toSeq title` as its source line, uses the non-severity `agent` variant (violet `--agent`), and clicks through to the RECEIVER; every other toast keeps one origin and a severity variant.
- **Why:** The event's whole content is who wrote to whom, and the click target is the receiver's terminal — a sender-only source line would make the accessible name announce the wrong destination; reusing `info` was rejected because blue already means `dev3 notify` / watched-status.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §5.7, `src/mainview/toast.tsx`, `decisions/2026/08/14/agent-message-toast-two-identities.md`.

## 2026-08-14 — An agent-written log gets a capped preview, not a whole screen

- **Rule:** Object-scoped content an agent appends to without a ceiling (task notes) shows the newest 3 entries on the object's surface, each body clamped to 6 lines with an overflow-gated Show more, plus a count and one `Show all N` row into its own overlay (BottomSheet narrow / dialog wide).
- **Why:** 2 999 of 3 030 notes are agent-written and the tail is 143 notes / 313 321 chars — 45 900 px of scroll in the mobile actions sheet — but the median task holds exactly one 790-char note, so the rejected alternative (move the whole section behind a row + count badge) taxed >75% of tasks with a tap to fix 5%.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §5.8 + §10, `src/mainview/components/TaskNotesOverlay.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/task-info-panel/TaskNotes.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — Settings → Agents is a preset library, not nested accordions

- **Rule:** A Settings entry owning dozens of same-shaped records renders a filterable list plus exactly one detail editor inside the category pane, grouped by the labels the consuming surface already shows (Agents: the launch picker's Model → Mode); narrow shows the list first, then the editor with a back affordance.
- **Why:** 98 shipped presets behind three accordion levels with no search made finding or editing one a scroll hunt, and opening an editor pushed the other 39 rows off-screen; the rejected alternative — a dense sortable table with a drawer — buys bulk actions nobody asked for at the price of a data-grid pattern Settings has no precedent for.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §8, `src/mainview/components/global-settings/AgentSettingsSection.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — One dropdown, optionally searchable and creatable

- **Rule:** `Select.tsx` stays the app's only dropdown; `searchable` adds an in-panel filter input and `allowCustom` commits typed text as the value, so a shipped enum can never block a value the agent CLI already accepts.
- **Why:** Model ids, permission modes and effort levels change faster than dev3 ships, and a fixed list silently caps the user at yesterday's options; a separate Combobox component was rejected because the app would then own two dropdowns with two keyboard contracts.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `docs/ux/PRODUCT_UX_BIBLE.md` §7, `src/mainview/components/Select.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/__tests__/Select.test.tsx`.

## 2026-08-10 — Whose-code identity is accent on the board, warning only on the diff

- **Rule:** `Task.foreignCode` renders as an accent eye glyph (§5.6, second identity marker) on the card and inspector, while the `warning`-toned RUNS badge sits on changed executable-config files in the diff viewer.
- **Why:** the glyph reports an identity, not a fault, and `danger` already means "deleted" in that same diff row — a rejected amber-card variant would have spent the warning token on the happy path and trained click-through. A branch-level marker on the card was also rejected: the card shows no branch to qualify.
- **Narrow panes:** a badge added to a file-header row must never buy its space from the file name. The diff file header is its own query container (the pane squeezes it, not the window): under ~28rem the badge's word goes `sr-only` and the sign plus tooltip carry it, under ~22rem the path/copy/stats group drops to a full-width row. Measured cost after that: zero — hiding the badge changes neither header height nor basename width.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `ForeignCodeMark.tsx`, `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `shared/executable-config-files.ts`, `decisions/2026/08/10/trust-the-branch-not-the-project.md`.

## 2026-08-10 — A send marks the review, it never deletes it

- **Rule:** No send path (per-comment, composer `Send now`, or batch) may clear inline review comments; they are stamped `Sent`, and only the confirmed `Reset review` destroys anything.
- **Why:** A resolved send proves the keystrokes left dev3, not that the agent read them — a reviewer lost a whole review to a send that never landed; the rejected alternative, clearing only on a proven `delivered`, still deletes on the common tmux case where the agent's TUI swallows the paste.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (`markInlineCommentsSent`), `decisions/2026/08/10/never-destroy-a-review-on-send.md`.

## 2026-08-10 — Review export card is a title line; the composer owns the one-shot send

- **Rule:** The export cluster (count + Copy + Send + icon-only Reset) sits on the card's title line, renders nothing when the review is empty, and the count is plain text — never a bordered box; the composer gains `Send now`, which delivers one remark and drops it.
- **Why:** A reviewer's single remark cost three clicks (add → send → delete) and the card spent a third of the aside on two full-width rare-use buttons plus a boxed number that read as an editable input; keeping the batch buttons full-width was rejected as the thing being complained about.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (`addAndSendInlineComment`, `InlineCommentComposer`), bible §5.3.

## 2026-08-08 — The memory breakdown may kill leftover worktree processes, and nothing else

- **Rule:** one conditional section at the bottom of the dev3 group in the memory popover/BottomSheet lists processes still running inside task worktrees; three ghost-danger controls — `Kill all` behind `confirm({ danger: true })`, a hover-revealed per-row kill with no dialog, and a rescan icon. Gated on `count > 0`, no empty state, scanned on open + once at startup, never in the poller. Bible §12.6, yaml `global_header.ambient_resource_readout.reclaim_action`.
- **Why:** the readout's charter is answering "who took my memory" without flattering our own share — refusing to let the user reclaim *our* leak would be that flattery, and a dialog per row would tax the safe, precise choice to protect the sweeping one. Rejected: a Settings → Maintenance screen (a destination for a rare fault nobody would open); a startup toast (this row explicitly forbids pressure toasts); silently auto-killing everything (a worktree still claimed by a live task can legitimately hold a running browser).
- **Status:** proposed. Evidence: `MemoryBreakdownPanel.tsx`, `src/bun/worktree-reaper.ts`, `decisions/2026/08/08/reap-worktree-cwd-holders-on-teardown.md`.

## 2026-08-08 — An archived task reaches its images and artifacts as enumerated rows

- **Rule:** the archived (completed/cancelled) task modal lists every `dev3 show-image` image and `dev3 show-artifact` artifact as its own clickable row above Notes (`SharedOutputsList.tsx`); rows open the App-hosted viewers at their own index, the artifact viewer as a standalone overlay. Bible §3, yaml `task_image_viewer.reached_from` / `task_artifact_workspace.standalone_overlay`.
- **Why:** the live task's Runtime-bar count badges are a *status* affordance and need a Runtime bar; an archived task has neither, and re-running a finished task to see its own screenshots is absurd. Rejected: reusing the count badges (one click, no enumeration); a thumbnail grid (up to 30 `readImageBase64` round-trips on modal open — the viewer's own thumbnail rail already covers visual browsing).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `SharedOutputsList.tsx`, `TaskDetailModal.tsx (ArchivedView)`, `decisions/2026/08/08/archived-task-shared-outputs.md`, seq 1469.

## 2026-08-08 — On a phone the memory readout folds into the kebab like everything else

- **Rule:** the global header's ambient resource readout (memory headroom) is a roomy-width slot only; on narrow it moves into the kebab bottom sheet next to `PreventSleepToggle` / `RateLimitIndicator`, keeps its ≥44px target there, and still opens its breakdown as a `BottomSheet`. Bible §12.6, yaml `surfaces.global_header.ambient_resource_readout.narrow`, `responsive.global_header`. Supersedes the narrow half of the 2026-07-30 entry below.
- **Why:** the 2026-07-30 rule argued the readout matters most where screen is scarce — in practice a phone header has room for a breadcrumb and one kebab, and a number the user does not act on at a glance is exactly what should give that room back. The desktop half of the rule is unchanged: capacity is still permanent chrome at roomy widths, still capped at one.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `MemoryHeadroomIndicator.tsx`, seq 1463.

## 2026-08-08 — A phone scales per screen: dense to work in, roomy to browse

- **Rule:** the phone's root font-size factor is chosen by route, not fixed. Working surfaces — a task's terminal, diff and inspector, and the project terminal — keep `MOBILE_DENSE_FACTOR` 0.67, where the point is to fit as much as a ~400px viewport holds. Everything the user only browses and taps — Kanban board, dashboard, settings, stats, changelog — gets `MOBILE_ROOMY_FACTOR` 0.84 (+25%). Mapping in `mobileDensityForRoute()`. A `BottomSheet` is a browse-and-tap surface wherever it opens, so it scales itself up to roomy with a local CSS `zoom` (`overlayScaleUp()`) instead of moving the root — the root would reflow the terminal underneath it.
- **Why:** 0.67 was tuned against a task and then applied everywhere; on the board it put a card title at 9.4px and turned a column into a thumbnail of a desktop board. Rejected: raising the global factor (costs the task view a third of its content); a user-facing density setting (a preference for something the route already answers); per-component overrides on the board (the whole screen is undersized, not a handful of labels).
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `zoom.ts`, `decisions/2026/08/08/phone-density-is-per-screen-not-global.md`, seq 1459.

## 2026-08-07 — A narrow control row sheds; it never stacks

- **Rule:** every narrow control row is `flex-nowrap` with a written priority order and drops from the bottom of it as width runs out — the inspector summary bar sheds diff badge → artifacts → images, then takes the status pill icon-only; the diff viewer's four mutually exclusive modes collapse to one trigger + `BottomSheet`. Anything shed must already have a sheet path, and the last survivors truncate rather than clip. Thresholds are container queries on the row, not viewport breakpoints. Bible §12.6 + §12.3 (Diff viewer).
- **Why:** a second row costs a phone a whole band of screen and moves every control the user was aiming at, which is worse than losing the least important one; measured at 340px the summary bar went 40px → 67px tall. Rejected: JS measured overflow via `ResizeObserver` (oscillates once hiding an item shrinks `scrollWidth`, and needs an offscreen clone to recover the natural width); a viewport breakpoint (the row is not the window — the same width holds a different bar depending on whether a variant switcher and output badges exist); folding the readouts unconditionally (they are status, and §12.6 keeps them resting-visible whenever they fit).
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` (`task-summary-bar`, `diff-summary-badge`), `TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (narrow mode row), seq 1459.

## 2026-08-07 — The Active Tasks sidebar row carries the Kanban card's lifecycle rail

- **Rule:** the sidebar row mounts `TaskCardRail` with `autoLabel` — ring, bell and the glued ✓ → Completed always, and the upright status word only when the rail measures tall enough to hold it whole — then title → signals → a muted identity line; the agent config no longer opens the row. Menu state is one shared `useStatusMenu` + `StatusMenuPortal` across both surfaces. Bible §5 sidebar row, §5.6, §9 budget.
- **Why:** an upright letter is ~14.4px and the rail is `self-stretch`, so on a short row the word sets the height instead of describing it (144-159px against a 96px baseline) — but a row carrying an overview is 273px and has room to spare, so the answer is per-row, not per-surface. Rejected: always-on full labels, three-letter forms (101px and a second status vocabulary in three locales), and dropping the word outright (71-88px, but it loses the word on the tall rows that had room). Evidence: `ActiveTaskRow.tsx`, `decisions/2026/08/07/sidebar-rail-short-labels.md`.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ActiveTaskRow.tsx`, `useStatusMenu.ts`, `StatusMenuPortal.tsx`, seq 1415.

## 2026-08-07 — Every toast has one anatomy, and its origin is resolved centrally

- **Rule:** Where a toast came from never changes its shape: source line → message → click target → swipe **and** X **and** timeout. The line falls back task → project → app area (`Settings`/`Update`/`Dashboard`/`Terminal`/`Menu`), first match wins, so no toast is ever bare; an area is a label with no click target. A caller passes ONE token (`taskId`/`projectId`/`source`) and `ToastHost` composes the rest via a resolver injected by `App.tsx`, once at emit, never per render. Bible §5.7, yaml `surfaces.toast`.
- **Why:** with many parallel tasks a bare sentence cannot say which task it is about — CLI push toasts already carried the source line, in-app ones did not. Rejected: composing `context`/`onClick` at each of ~180 call sites (drifts again on the next toast anyone writes); letting `toast.tsx` import app state (a module-level service would depend on the reducer); and stamping every originless toast with `dev-3.0` (a uniform line that carries nothing is fabrication by another route). Resolving per render passed every unit test yet lost a live toast's line and click target as soon as the user left the project — hence once at emit.
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `src/mainview/toast.tsx`, `src/mainview/App.tsx` (`ToastHost` mount, `openTaskFromNotification`), seq 1437.

## 2026-08-06 — Opening a viewed artifact in the real browser is one icon next to download

- **Rule:** The artifact viewer header gets one neutral external-link icon beside download; desktop hands the stored HTML path to the OS browser via RPC, browser/remote opens a blob URL synchronously in the click (§10 hand-off row). The header is now full at six controls.
- **Why:** The real browser owns find, print, zoom, devtools and a window that outlives dev3 navigation, so the escape hatch belongs on the document; a context-menu-only entry was rejected because the viewer has no context menu and would be invisible on touch.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `src/bun/rpc-handlers/app-handlers.ts`.

## 2026-08-05 — A sensitive project is masked, locked and silent — but only while streamer mode is on

- **Rule:** `Project.sensitive` (toggle in Project Settings → Board) is inert until `data-streamer="on"`; then the project name and its task text carry `streamer-private` everywhere outside the project, its dashboard row / picker option stays visible but `aria-disabled` with a lock glyph and an info toast on click, the `navigate()` choke point in `App.tsx` refuses routes into it (and redirects out when the mode turns on), and every notification path drops its events. `document.title` gets a neutral placeholder — CSS cannot blur a tab title. Bible §3 + §10, yaml `sensitive-project-masked-locked-and-silent`.
- **Why:** the flag guards one moment (camera on) against one accident (a click into the wrong project), so one routing guard beats ~10 per-entry-point guards. Rejected: hiding the project entirely (reads as data loss, and hides that the guard works), a header indicator (chrome creep — the row's lock is the indicator), an unlock-for-this-session hatch (the hatch is turning streamer mode off).
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `decisions/2026/07/23/streamer-mode-css-blur-masking.md`, `src/mainview/streamer-mode.tsx`, `src/mainview/App.tsx` (`navigate`), `src/bun/rpc-handlers/shared.ts` (`deliverTaskNotification`).

## 2026-08-05 — The dashboard task row carries exactly one object action: ✓ Complete

- **Rule:** each dashboard task row ends in one ✓ Complete (hover/focus-revealed on desktop, always visible ≥44×44 on narrow, always `alwaysConfirm`, hidden while hibernated) and never gains a second row action, kebab, or context menu. Bible §10 row `object_action — the one dashboard exception`, yaml `placement_rules.dashboard-task-row-single-complete`.
- **Why:** the dashboard is the attention triage list, so clearing a finished row is the job that screen exists for, and the row is the task's own surface rather than app chrome — which is what `task-scoped-actions-in-inspector-or-menu` meant to protect. Rejected: a per-row kebab (turns triage into a second board) and a narrow-only long-press (leaves the desktop pain in the issue unfixed).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ActivityOverview.tsx`, `utils/moveTaskToStatus.ts (onFailure)`, issue #1252.

## 2026-08-05 — Hover raises emphasis; it never creates the control

- **Rule:** An action cluster may not be hidden behind `opacity-0` → `group-hover:opacity-100`. It rests at a visible tone (`text-fg-3`, the quietest step clearing 3:1 on the light theme's `surface-raised`) and hover only lifts it to `text-fg` + `bg-elevated` — destructive to `text-danger` + `bg-danger/10`.
- **Why:** The Dashboard project row hid settings / Finder / project-terminal / remove entirely until hover, so the four actions were undiscoverable and inconsistent with the drag + up/down reorder affordances in the same row, which were already resting-visible. Rejected alternative: keep hover-reveal and only raise the revealed contrast — it fixes legibility but not discoverability.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/ProjectActionButtons.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/ActivityOverview.tsx`.
- **Open tension:** the ✓ Complete action landed on the dashboard *task* row the same day is still hover-revealed on desktop. It is the one known exception to this rule and has not been reconciled yet.

## 2026-08-06 — Agent outputs ride the narrow summary bar, and are duplicated in the sheet

- **Rule:** On narrow, `Images` / `Artifacts` render as conditional 44px readouts on the inspector summary bar next to priority AND stay as rows in the actions sheet (`surfaces.task_inspector`, bible §12.6).
- **Why:** An unread output must be visible without opening a kebab — the same status-not-action logic as the ambient header readout; folding them (the shipped behaviour) hid a produced artifact behind two taps, and the sheet copy is kept because the sheet is the phone's complete action inventory.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/task-info-panel/TaskSharedImages.tsx`.

## 2026-08-03 — Local review comments send one-by-one; the batch send covers only unsent ones

- **Rule:** Every local inline review comment carries its own `Send to agent` (role `secondary`, beside Edit/Delete, sending/sent states + toasts); a sent comment is marked `Sent` and leaves the Review export card's copy/batch-send payload, which is now scoped to unsent comments. Bible §5.3, yaml `surfaces.diff_review_viewer.inline_comment_actions`.
- **Why:** reviewers want a comment delivered the moment they write it, and a batch that still carries already-sent comments makes the agent re-handle them. Rejected: keeping send batch-only (the reported pain) and hiding sent comments from the card (they must stay visible and re-readable).
- **Status:** Decided. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/pr-review/GithubThreadView.tsx`.

## 2026-08-03 — A shortcut has a primary slot and an alias slot; presets are not a way to turn shortcuts off

- **Rule:** every shortcut carries two independently-editable slots (primary + optional alias) rather than a flat binding list, and a per-shortcut editor replaces any "compatibility preset" toggle — the iTerm2 preset and its three checkboxes (Settings, ⓘ popover, native Terminal ▸ Keyboard Mode) are deleted, its four ⌘ combos are now plain `terminal`-group registry rows. The ⓘ button opens the ⌘/ overlay's Terminal tab instead of a partial popover. Yaml `surfaces.keyboard_shortcuts_editor`.
- **Why:** a preset that only exists to disable four shortcuts is redundant once each row can be unbound, and duplicating that switch in three surfaces is how the same setting drifts; slots make "the second way to press it" a thing the user sets rather than an artifact of list order. Rejected: keeping the checkbox alongside the editor (two mechanisms, one outcome), and teaching the matcher that terminal shortcuts outrank app ones (the ⌘[ collision it would fix disappears once the redundant bindings go — tmux already owns ⌥+arrows).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `decisions/2026/08/03/shortcut-slots-and-no-iterm2-preset.md`, `keymap.ts`, `ShortcutRow.tsx`, `TerminalView.tsx`, `shared/application-menu.ts`.

## 2026-08-02 — The keymap registry now dispatches, and rebinding lives in Settings, not the ⌘/ overlay

- **Rule:** `keymap.ts` holds machine-readable bindings and drives dispatch (`matchesShortcut(e, id)`); rebinding is `configuration` and belongs to a new eighth Settings category **Keyboard** (which also absorbs the terminal keymap preset), while the ⌘/ overlay stays read-only reference showing the *resolved* combo plus one "Customize…" link. Structural bindings (g-chords, ⌘1–9 families, hold-modifier switcher, Esc) render read-only **with a stated reason**. Bible §5.2, yaml `surfaces.keyboard_shortcuts_editor`.
- **Why:** the 2026-06-19 "registry documents, does not dispatch" split made user rebinding impossible without editing two places, so it had to be reversed; a per-shortcut matcher confines the risk that entry feared to one tested function instead of a rewrite. Rejected: editing inside the ⌘/ overlay (durable configuration in a help surface), and hiding non-remappable rows (an editor that silently omits a third of the keymap reads as broken).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `keymap.ts`, `keymap-bindings.ts`, `KeyboardSettingsSection.tsx`, `ShortcutRow.tsx`, `settings-registry.ts`, `App.tsx`. Supersedes the dispatch half of the 2026-06-19 entry.

## 2026-08-01 — Split resize lives on the boundary, never in a toolbar

- **Rule:** Native terminal split boundaries carry a `role="separator"` grab strip (resting grip, ≥9px hit target, `col-resize`/`row-resize`, ghost line, commit on release, Arrow-key steps) and no control anywhere else; absent for a single pane, a zoomed pane, and the narrow carousel. Bible §10 row `layout boundary manipulation`, yaml `surfaces.native_terminal_panes`.
- **Why:** the boundary is a direct-manipulation object, so a "Resize panes" button would be chrome on the one canvas the app keeps chrome-free, and an invisible boundary is undiscoverable without a resting grip. Rejected: keyboard-only resize (it already existed and nobody found it) and per-pointermove commits (SIGWINCH storm repainting every TUI).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `NativePaneDividers.tsx`, `TaskTerminal.tsx`, `split-tree.ts (getSplitBoundaries)`, `rpc-handlers/task-panes.ts (setSplitRatio)`.

## 2026-07-31 — An agent request keeps one identity, but borrows its severity from the action

- **Rule:** Every agent-initiated request wears the same identity (accent border, AI-agent-request badge, autofocused decline) while the accepting button takes its role from what the action does — `destructive` for completion, `primary` for a launch; a request needing more than yes/no gets its own modal and `confirm()` stays boolean. Bible §6 row `agent_request`, yaml `surfaces.modal.agent_request`.
- **Why:** the 2026-06-10 completion rule bundled identity and severity, so a second instance (an agent asking to *start* a task, which is reversible and creates state) would have shipped a red button for a safe action and spent the danger token on nothing. Rejected: extending `confirm()` to host the agent picker — that turns a boolean service into a form host.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `AgentLaunchRequestModal.tsx`, `TaskDialogSubjectCard.tsx`, `confirm.tsx`, `agent-requests.ts`, `cli-socket-server.ts`. Extends the 2026-06-10 entry.

## 2026-07-30 — Capacity telemetry is permanent header chrome; faults are not

- **Rule:** Host-machine capacity (memory headroom) gets **one** permanent global-header readout at every width — framed as headroom *left*, coloured by the OS's own pressure verdict — plus a non-blocking banner at the launch decision point. Capped at one; a second ambient readout folds into the narrow sheet. Bible §5, §10 row `ambient resource telemetry`, §12.6.
- **Why:** §5.5 doctrine keeps *faults* (transport health, diagnostics) as conditional chrome so the happy path stays clean, and that reads as forbidding this widget — but capacity is a continuous decision input: the user learns *normal* only by seeing it while nothing is wrong, and needs it with zero tasks running. Same class as the always-on prevent-sleep toggle, not an error indicator. Rejected: a pressure-only conditional pill (too late to inform a launch), folding it into the narrow kebab (kills the signal exactly when screen is scarce and load is high), and colouring by an invented percentage threshold (meaningless across 8 GB and 512 GB machines).
- **Status:** Proposed. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `PreventSleepToggle.tsx` (`--awake` precedent), `BottomSheet.tsx`, `SiblingPopover.tsx` (popover row → navigate precedent).

## 2026-07-30 — Hibernated is a card state, not a column or a card action

A hibernated task keeps its column and renders inert everywhere it is listed (greyed +
dashed `text-fg-muted` label, drag off, status trigger disabled, quick-complete still
live); the Hibernate control itself sits in the inspector's Session/Agent bar (4th
action, at budget) and never on the board card, so waking stays an explicit act inside
the task. It wears `warning` (amber) and a filled skull: `danger` is reserved for
irreversible loss and the same bar already spends it on Bug Hunters, while the one
illustrative glyph in a 2px-stroke set is what makes a rare, costly action visible at
17px. It is confirmed: nothing on disk is touched, but the session dies for good, so the
dialog leads with what survives and counts the agents when the task runs more than one.
Rejected: a dedicated column (the board must keep
telling the truth about where the work is), and a red skull (two reds in a four-button
bar make red decorative). Evidence: `decisions/2026/07/31/task-hibernation-property-not-runtime-phase.md`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-30 — A global default's rare per-object override lives in that object's detail modal

- **Rule:** a durable machine-local preference lives in Global Settings (bible §10 `configuration`); its rare per-object exception lives in the object's **detail modal** as a low-emphasis segmented control — never on the board, a toolbar/header, the create modal, or live object chrome. An unavailable choice stays visible, `disabled`, with its reason in `--warning` text next to it. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/global-settings/TerminalBackendSetting.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/TaskTerminalBackendRow.tsx`.
- **Why:** the terminal-backend rollout needed both a fleet-wide default and a one-task escape hatch; the modal already allows `focused_config`, so the exception rides an existing surface instead of adding toolbar buttons (the project's top anti-pattern). Rejected: a board card affordance and a Create Task field — both would advertise a rare expert switch on the happy path.

## 2026-07-30 — Find-in-content follows the content, not the viewer header

- **Rule:** `⌘F` over a viewer's rendered content puts the search UI in that surface's *content* toolbar where one exists (diff viewer §5.3), otherwise on a floating top-right bar over the content, focus-gated to that viewer; the header may carry **exactly one** magnifier icon that toggles that bar and nothing else. Bible §10 row `find in content`.
- **Why:** the two live precedents disagreed (diff viewer = toolbar toggle, terminal = floating keyboard-only bar), and the artifact header is artifact-level chrome already at 8 slots — so the search *field* stays out of it while one icon is an accepted §11 exception (user-requested: a keyboard-only find is invisible to a pointer user). Rejected: a search input in the header, and multiple entry points per viewer.
- **Status:** Observed (artifact viewer). Evidence: `TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `ArtifactSearchBar.tsx`, `TerminalSearchBar.tsx`, `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `utils/artifactDocument.ts`, `keymap.ts`.

## 2026-07-29 — Artifact bundles separate authoring from the stable shell

- **Rule:** A task artifact is an HTML entrypoint plus explicit local CSS/classic-JS/raster assets; agents normally edit only `index.html` and `report.js`, while the opaque-origin iframe sandbox provides isolation and CSP stays permissive for artifact runtimes.
- **Why:** The single 800-line file forced agents to consume formatting code for content-only work; restrictive per-capability CSP repeatedly broke legitimate local and CDN assets without strengthening the sandbox boundary.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `shared-artifacts.ts`, `artifactDocument.ts`, `artifact-template/AUTHORING.md`, decision 179. Supersedes the 2026-07-09 entry's security/export details.

## 2026-07-28 — A lifecycle split-control counts as ONE task-card inline action

- **Rule:** The card's status control may carry a second half that commits the pipeline's own terminal move (today: a ✓ straight to Completed) and still spends one slot of the §9 `max_inline_actions: 2` budget — but only when it is glued to the status trigger, shares its hover surface, is desktop-only (the narrow path stays the BottomSheet's promoted Completed row, ≥44px), and hides whenever `getAllowedTransitions` forbids the target. Anything not on the object's own lifecycle is a normal action and costs its own slot.
- **Why:** Completing was two clicks on the densest surface, and a standalone card button is exactly the toolbar-button-creep the budget exists to stop; scoping the exception to the control's own lifecycle move keeps it from becoming the loophole. A duplicate "Complete task" CTA under the menu was rejected — the Completed row is promoted (success role + ✓) instead of doubled. Confirmation is unchanged: `moveTaskToStatus` → `confirmTaskCompletion`.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `PipelineRing.tsx`, `PipelineDropdown.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, bible §9/§11.

## 2026-07-25 — Transport health is a docked pill + per-screen fetch states, not a banner

- **Rule:** While the remote transport is unhealthy, a conditional pill in the bottom-left `StatusDock` names the state and *is* the retry, then confirms recovery for ~2.5s; every transport-fed screen owes a delayed skeleton, a retry panel, and a self-heal refetch on reconnect (cached data always wins).
- **Why:** Post-boot the app read as frozen — `BootstrapScreen` only covers launch, so a dropped socket left a stale board and silently queued actions for the 120s RPC timeout. A header dot/banner was rejected (permanent chrome + layout shift on phones), a toast too (transient signal for a persisting condition). Bible §5.5 + §10.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `StatusDock.tsx`, `ConnectionStatusPill.tsx`, `ProjectView.tsx`, `KanbanBoardSkeleton.tsx`, `BoardLoadFailed.tsx`.

## 2026-07-25 — A read-only terminal viewer says so, in an earned strip above the canvas

- **Rule:** A native task terminal shared by several viewers (desktop window + remote tabs) gives exactly one of them the write lease; an observer gets a slim NON-overlapping strip directly above the canvas naming the read-only state plus a `Take control` button (secondary, bordered), and that strip flashes `danger` for ~1.6s when the server refuses a keystroke. Writers — and every tmux terminal — get zero chrome.
- **Why:** A silently read-only terminal is indistinguishable from a hung one. An absolute overlay badge (PaneZoomBadge's pattern) was rejected because it collides with the narrow pane-dots strip; a toast per refused keystroke was rejected as spam for an expected, persisting condition. Follows the existing slim-strip pattern (window switcher/pane dots), so wide and narrow are identical. Bible §5 terminal surfaces.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `NativeViewerBar.tsx`, `TaskTerminal.tsx`, `decisions/2026/07/26/native-terminal-remote-viewer-bridge.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Inspector bars adapt to the PANEL's width, not the viewport's

- **Rule:** A toolbar that shares the viewport with another surface gates its label/fold behaviour on its own container width (`useContainerWidth`, ResizeObserver), not on `useCompact`/`useNarrowViewport`; and every bar is boxed (`min-w-0 overflow-hidden`) so it can never paint over a neighbour or the pinned chrome. Inspector tiers: `tight` <1280 (label strip → `+k`, branch clamp, tmux/Runtime icon-only), `veryTight` <900 (drop label strip + include-tests).
- **Why:** In split view the panel is 400-600px narrower than the window, so viewport gates never fired and both rows overflowed — chrome and Runtime controls landed outside the panel's `overflow-hidden` box, unclickable. Wrapping was rejected (fixed collapsed height clips the second line); lowering `COMPACT_MAX_WIDTH` was rejected (wrong axis). Bible §5.1/§12.1; `decisions/2026/07/25/inspector-bars-adapt-to-panel-width.md`.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `useContainerWidth.ts`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-23 — Streamer mode: privacy masking is a CSS class contract

- **Rule:** Identity-bearing display values (emails, account labels, orgs, home-dir paths, tunnel URLs, QR) must carry `streamer-private`/`streamer-private-media`; `data-streamer="on"` on `<html>` blurs them. Toggle = Settings → Appearance (`local` storage) + `⇧⌘P` palette command; no header button, no hover-to-reveal.
- **Why:** CSS-only masking makes coverage one class per value with zero re-render; text replacement was rejected (per-surface logic, silent misses). Bible §10 row; `decisions/2026/07/23/streamer-mode-css-blur-masking.md`.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/mainview/streamer-mode.tsx`, `index.css`.

## 2026-07-21 — Inline-help coverage floor is a positive manifest (REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES)

- **Rule:** `help.ts` exports `REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES`, the curated list of canonical §5 surfaces/sections; `help.test.ts` asserts each resolves to a topic AND mounts a reachable zone, in addition to the existing dangling/orphan checks. Closing the pre-doctrine backlog wired ~20 new topics (viewers, config modals, project-settings tabs, two settings sub-sections, diff files/PR-conversation, inspector notes/metadata).
- **Why:** The dangling/orphan checks only police *referenced* ids, so a surface with no help id at all was invisible — many pre-§5.4 surfaces carried zero help and read as "fine". A positive floor makes "help is owed" enforceable (keymap.ts-style lockstep). Rejected: a permanent (i) per field (creep — help mode covers dense/headerless zones) and enumerating every sub-zone (floor tracks surfaces, not sub-zones).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `help.ts` (`REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES`), `__tests__/help.test.ts`, bible §5.4 (coverage floor), yaml `surfaces.inline_help.doctrine.coverage_floor`.

## 2026-07-20 — Active-tasks split is gated by viewport width, not browser mode

- **Rule:** The task workspace shows the standard `SplitLayout` + `ActiveTasksSidebar` on wide viewports (≥768px) in **both** desktop and remote/browser mode; only narrow (<768px, mobile) viewports drop it for a full-width terminal.
- **Why:** The 2026-07-19 strip removal over-reached — folding all browser mode into the narrow branch also hid the sidebar on wide remote screens, where there is ample room for it (`SplitLayout` only breaks ~<600px). The persistent `ActiveTasksStrip` stays gone; this only restores the sidebar for wide browsers.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ProjectView.tsx` (`isNarrow`-only gate), `useNarrowViewport.ts`.

## 2026-07-19 — Remove the persistent browser active-task strip

- **Rule:** Browser task workspaces keep the terminal full-width without a persistent `ActiveTasksStrip`; task switching uses the existing task-switcher overlay and breadcrumb → board navigation.
- **Why:** The strip consumed vertical space and exposed a distracting horizontal scrollbar without being the canonical task-switching surface. Rejected replacing it with another permanent row; existing task-switching surfaces already cover the workflow.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `ProjectView.tsx`, `TaskSwitcherOverlay.tsx`, `MobileBoardCarousel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-19 — GitHub PR review layer in the diff viewer is read-only

- **Rule:** The diff viewer renders the task PR's review threads + top-level conversation read-only (inline via the local-comment widget mechanism, branch mode only; one "Conversation (N)" control strip at the top of the stream); every item links out to GitHub; per-thread `Send to agent` / opt-in XML export with an origin marker. **No GitHub writes from this surface — no reply/resolve/authoring.**
- **Why:** Writing reviews from dev3 duplicates GitHub's own UI and adds auth/consistency risk for near-zero gain (grilling task 0fa9144c); the agent loop — not commenting — is the product's value. Rejected: reply/resolve buttons proxying `gh`.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `ux-architecture.yaml (github_review_layer)`.

## 2026-07-17 — Help coverage is owed; help mode is the master surface (correlation invariant)

- **Rule:** Every user-facing surface/section and every non-self-evident form field MUST have a `help.ts` topic reachable in help mode (`field.*` namespace), shipped in the same commit as the UI; every registry-backed `HelpSpot` auto-renders `data-help-id`, so inline help is always a subset of the (?) overlay; dangling ids and orphan topics are forbidden and `help.test.ts` guards both directions.
- **Why:** The product has no tutorials — the UI is the only channel to convey author intent, so coverage cannot be "earned" like tips; the HelpSpot/zone sets had already drifted silently (dangling `header.rateLimits` zone; the 2026-07-16 settings re-org killed help for three categories unnoticed). Rejected: a permanent (i) per form field (chrome creep — help mode lights registered fields instead, zero permanent chrome).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §5.4 (coverage law + correlation invariant), yaml `surfaces.inline_help.doctrine`, `HelpSpot.tsx`, `__tests__/help.test.ts`.

## 2026-07-16 — Global Settings category navigation and registry

- **Rule:** Global Settings uses seven left-nav **Settings categories** with one detail pane, localized title/description search, and a narrow list→detail drill-down with an in-app back affordance. The `settings-registry.ts` registry documents **Settings entries** (metadata, category, translations, anchors, storage disposition) and integrity tests; bespoke controls remain bespoke.
- **Why:** One category at a time keeps the large Agents and Accounts surfaces from burying smaller settings while preserving the existing route, RPC persistence, and editor behavior. Legacy section ids map through one vocabulary boundary so existing launch-picker deep-links continue to land on the correct current category.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `GlobalSettings.tsx`, `settings-registry.ts`, `docs/ux/ux-architecture.yaml`, `decisions/2026/07/16/global-settings-registry.md`.

## 2026-07-15 — Mobile devices are portrait-only

- **Rule:** `useMobile()` devices attempt a portrait Screen Orientation lock; when the browser rejects it, `MobilePortraitGate` blocks the root shell in landscape with a localized rotate prompt and inert underlying content. Narrowed desktop windows stay unchanged.
- **Why:** The landscape desktop toolbar is not functional on phones, while the lock API is limited and commonly requires fullscreen. A blocking fallback preserves a usable portrait UI; a settings toggle or rotated desktop layout would add configuration and complexity.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `MobilePortraitGate.tsx`, `usePortraitOrientation.ts`, bible §12.1/§12.3.

## 2026-07-13 — Terminal immersive fullscreen is app-only and ephemeral

- **Rule:** The TaskInfoPanel fullscreen toggle plus F11 / Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F enters a task-bound renderer view with only a thin `dev3` strip and a wide neutral Exit full screen button; agent-facing notifications and viewer events queue during immersive fullscreen or persistent Focus Mode and flush when the active mode ends, with notification clicks exiting immersive fullscreen before normal task navigation.
- **Why:** Keeping the existing Route and tmux session preserves the user's exact layout and makes the feature identical in desktop and browser mode. Rejected native/browser fullscreen and tmux `resize-pane -Z` because they either diverge by transport or overwrite user-controlled pane state.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `App.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `keymap.ts`, `webNotification.ts`.

## 2026-07-13 — "Recent commits" diff mode is a split-button, N not persisted

- **Rule:** A 4th diff mode `recent` joins the diff-viewer segmented control (peer to branch/uncommitted/unpushed): a split-button whose body activates `HEAD~N..HEAD` (committed-only, clamped to the branch's own commits via the local `origin/base` merge-base — no origin fetch) and whose `▾` caret opens a fixed preset popover (1/2/3/5/10). Mode follows the existing localStorage preference; N does **not** — it resets to 1 each open. Header sub-label shows the backend's effective (clamped) count, localized.
- **Why:** the primary job is "what did the agent just commit?", so the default must always be the last commit (N reset), while mode-stickiness matches the other three. A split-button keeps the frequent 1-click case zero-config yet bounds toolbar width for narrow/mobile vs inline chips. Rejected: persisting N (defeats the default), a commit-subject dropdown (needs a new `listCommits` RPC), and free numeric input (scope creep).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §5.3; `decisions/2026/07/13/recent-commits-diff-mode.md`; `git.ts` getTaskDiff, `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `rpc-handlers/git-operations.ts`.

## 2026-07-12 — Variant switching: capped clickable dots, inspector switcher, ⇧⌘[/] cycle

- **Rule:** One sibling affordance on both card surfaces — max 3 clickable status dots (self ring-highlighted + lowest variantIndexes, NO `+N` counter) opening an upgraded `SiblingPopover` (current-variant marker + per-variant titles); the inspector Context bar leads with a conditional segmented variant switcher (alive variants only, one composite control); `⇧⌘[`/`⇧⌘]` cycles alive variants (`keymap.ts`).
- **Why:** Per-variant cards stay honest to sidebar readiness tiers and diverged titles; the grilling (task seq 1042) rejected collapsing a group into one card and epic-style click-to-filter chips — the proven kanban dots+popover mechanic gets unified across surfaces and bounded instead.
- **Status:** Agreed, implementation pending. Rules: bible §5.1 + surface table + glossary; yaml `variant-switching-affordances` + `surfaces.task_card.variant_dots`.

## 2026-07-12 — PR Review always belongs in NEEDS YOU

- **Rule:** Every `review-by-colleague` task stays in the sidebar's top NEEDS YOU tier and the `is:attention` filter, regardless of its live bell count; WAITING contains only `in-progress` and `review-by-ai` tasks.
- **Why:** A pending PR is a human decision queue, not background agent churn; a bell marks new activity but must not decide whether a review is visible. Rejected: signal-gated promotion, which stranded quiet PRs below working tasks.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `sidebarTiers.ts`, `taskFacets.ts`, `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`; `decisions/2026/07/12/pr-review-needs-you-tier.md`.

## 2026-07-11 — Scheduled agent message ("Send later")

- **Rule:** A one-shot text queued to a task's **live agent** (deliver at a wall-clock time / after a delay; type + Enter) is a **session action**. Create it from the **Session/Agent inspector bar**, the card **context menu**, and a **clock button in the browser/touch `TerminalComposer`**; plus CLI `dev3 message [--in|--at] "…"` (bare = send now). Pending items render as a **card timer-chip** (popover: cancel / send-now) that **shares the single deferred-timer slot with deferred launch** — the two never coexist (`todo` vs live-agent). Reuses the `LaunchVariantsModal` in/at picker via an extracted shared `SchedulePicker`. Offered only when a live agent session exists.
- **Why:** it pokes a *running* agent, so it belongs to the session domain, not Runtime; reusing the launch picker + the one deferred-timer chip adds no new badge class and no budget exception. Excluded from the ⇧⌘P palette (modal/inline-flow policy, same as spawn) and it is not a destination. Rejected: extending Automations (they create *new tasks*, not message a live agent) and a bespoke "Reminders" panel.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `decisions/2026/07/11/scheduled-agent-message.md`; bible §5.1 (session_agent bar); `ScheduleMessageModal.tsx`, `SchedulePicker.tsx` (extracted from `LaunchVariantsModal.tsx`), `TaskCard.tsx` chip, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` session bar, `TerminalComposer.tsx`; `src/bun/scheduled-message-scheduler.ts`, `src/bun/agent-prompt.ts`; CLI `src/cli/commands/message.ts`.

## 2026-07-11 — Favorites: leading "Favorites" column on the launch picker (NOT a chip row / split)

- **Rule:** The Provider→Model→Mode picker (`AgentConfigPicker`) carries ONE compact favorites control as a **leading labeled column** (peer to Provider/Model/Mode) on the 3 **launch** surfaces (Launch/Retry, Spawn Agent, Bug Hunters) via `showFavorites`: a narrow fixed-width trigger with a Nerd Font **star that fills gold** (`--favorite`) when the current `(agentId,configId)` is saved, opening a left-aligned portal **popover** (`FavoritesMenu`, mirrors `PriorityPicker`) — top row toggles **Save ↔ Remove** the current combo (gold when saved), below it the list (click = apply to THIS picker, `×` per row removes, accent+check on the active one). Column **always present** (save reachable at 0 favorites). **No chip row, no 1-click row star.** Favorites are thin pointers stored globally (`GlobalSettings.favorites`, `{agentId,configId,uses,lastUsedAt}`), cap 10 LFU-then-LRU (just-added never evicted), ordered uses↓/lastUsedAt↓ frozen per open; usage increments per spawned agent on any matching launch. Settings pickers stay plain cascade.
- **Why:** the launch picker is instantiated **once per variant** in `LaunchVariantsModal`, so a chip row inside it (v1) rendered the global list N× and pushed cascades down; a right-side `[★│▾]` split (v2) dangled below the Selects (misaligned) with a weak thin `☆`. A leading labeled column aligns in-row, adds zero height, stays one earned icon (button-creep budget §11), and each trigger unambiguously targets its own picker; Save moved into the popover because pick is frequent and save rare. Rejected: top-of-modal row (ambiguous which variant), quick-add-variant chips (surface-inconsistent), a wide 4th text dropdown (width ×N), a favorites pseudo-provider, display-only cap without eviction. Sibling to decision 112.
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §10 (launch favorite row); `AgentConfigPicker.tsx`, `FavoritesMenu.tsx`, `src/shared/favorites.ts`, `rpc-handlers/settings-config.ts`; `docs/ux/feature-plans/agent-favorites.md`, `decisions/2026/07/11/agent-favorites.md`.

## 2026-07-10 — Token-DSL task filters: search string is the single source of truth

- **Rule:** Structured filtering on the board and sidebar is a token DSL (`priority:` `label:` `agent:` `status:` `is:attention` `has:port`) living inside the *one* search string; a shared `FilterFunnel` dropdown (grouped PRIORITY/STATUS/LABELS/AGENTS/FLAGS, PRIORITY first, values-in-pool only, empty groups hidden), the P0–P4 priority quick-chips, and the kanban label chips are all *views* of that string — checking/clicking edits a token, none holds separate filter state. Funnel is a `ghost` icon button snug against the search box with an accent count badge; one `HelpSpot` teaches the operators. Filter/checked use different comparisons: substring match filters, exact (case-insensitive) token presence drives checked/active. Board shows the most-popular labels inline (`+N more` opens the funnel). Ephemeral (resets on unmount), renderer-only, extensible registry.
- **Why:** a growing task list needs AND-across / OR-within filtering both surfaces share; one parsed string keeps typed and clicked filters from ever disagreeing and adds one control, not a facet toolbar. This **supersedes the priority feature's separate `priorityFilters`/`activeFilters` board state** (PR #893) — folding priority into the same single-source string is the whole point. Rejected: a separate structured-filter state beside search (two sources drift), and dropping the chips (loses at-a-glance board filtering).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §5 (board/sidebar rows), §12.6 board-filters row; `utils/taskSearch.ts`, `taskFacets.ts`, `FilterFunnel.tsx`, `LabelFilterBar.tsx`, `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`; `decisions/2026/07/10/token-dsl-task-filters.md`.

## 2026-07-10 — Diagnostics: in-UI crash/error surface for remote/mobile

- **Rule:** One framework-agnostic diagnostics store feeds three surfaces — a provider-wrapping `RootErrorBoundary` (self-contained English fallback), a phase+timeout `BootstrapScreen` (Retry/Reload replaces the bare spinner), and a `DiagnosticsPanel` opened from a floating pill that appears ONLY in remote mode when `errorCount > 0` (plus a pre-React loader in `index.html`).
- **Why:** Mobile/remote users have no devtools; crashes blanked the page and stuck loads spun silently. Rejected a permanent header/menu diagnostics button (button-creep, and dead on a crashed tree) and an external error reporter (doesn't let the user see/copy it on the phone). The pill is earned, not permanent.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `diagnostics.ts`, `RootErrorBoundary.tsx`, `BootstrapScreen.tsx`, `DiagnosticsPanel.tsx`, `DiagnosticsIndicator.tsx`; bible §5.5.

## 2026-07-09 — HTML Artifacts: sandboxed task workspace + separate Runtime control

- Placement and Runtime-control rules remain in bible §5; the security/export contract is superseded by the 2026-07-29 artifact-bundle decision.

## 2026-07-06 — Feature-gated preset: shown-but-disabled + deep-link to enable

- **Rule:** a preset that depends on an off-by-default capability (e.g. `requiresPxpipeProxy`) stays **visible** in the Provider→Model→Mode picker but renders **disabled** (`Select` disabled option, muted + lock glyph) until enabled; clicking it does not select — it fires a clickable `info` toast that deep-links (window `OPEN_SETTINGS_SECTION_EVENT` → `Route.section`) to the Global Settings section that turns it on. Its manager is a normal settings section (configuration lives in settings).
- **Why:** the user must be able to *discover* the capability without it silently launching a heavy/experimental dependency. Rejected: hiding the preset until enabled (undiscoverable) and auto-starting the dependency on selection (hidden side effect).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: bible §10 (feature-gated preset row), `AgentConfigPicker.tsx`, `Select.tsx`, `PxpipeProxySettingsSection.tsx`, `decisions/2026/07/06/pxpipe-cost-trick-preset.md`.

## 2026-07-05 — Automations: project-settings tab; runs are ordinary tasks

- **Rule:** The `Automation` object (RRULE+tz schedule + prompt + agent, per project) is durable configuration → CRUD lives in a 4th `ProjectSettings` tab (tabs 3→4, budget ≤6); each fire creates a **normal task** on the board (clock-glyph provenance on the card); run history + missed-run status render only inside the tab; failures/missed runs surface via toast + status, never silently.
- **Why:** configuration-in-settings rule + nav budget ≤7. Rejected: a top-level "Automations" destination (a single-feature screen violates the nav budget) and a board-level panel (durable config on an operational surface).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: bible §3 (Automation), yaml `objects.automation`, `ProjectSettings.tsx`, `automations-scheduler.ts`.

## 2026-07-05 — Agent rate-limit indicator is ambient header status, not a cockpit metric

- **Rule:** account-wide agent rate-limit usage renders as a passive icon+percent indicator in the global header's stateful-indicators zone (next to prevent-sleep); hidden until data exists, `warning` token ≥80%, `danger` ≥95%; its enable toggle lives in Global Settings → Agents (`rate-limit-tracking` entry, `settings-registry.ts`).
- **Why:** it is a diagnostic "battery gauge" the user must see before hitting a limit — not a motivational countable signal (cockpit rejected) and not task-scoped (task surfaces rejected).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `ux-architecture.yaml` global_header.allowed.
## 2026-07-03 — Inline help: one registry, three layers (Tooltip / HelpSpot / help mode)

- **Rule:** Help content lives in a `src/mainview/help.ts` registry (declare-as-data, like `keymap.ts`/`tips.ts`); a fast `Tooltip` primitive progressively replaces native `title=` on icon controls; a ghost (i) `HelpSpot` → rich read-only `HelpCard` is allowed only in header-bearing sections (≤1 each); dense headerless zones (inspector quickbars, task card) are covered by a screen-wide help-mode overlay (`⇧⌘/`, Help menu, palette, kebab on narrow) via `data-help-id` — never by permanent icons. Bible §5.4.
- **Why:** Native `title=` (~227 usages) is slow and control-scoped, and per-section (i) icons everywhere would be toolbar-button-creep wearing a help hat. Rejected: (i) in every zone (creep); help-mode-only (no ambient discoverability); tooltip-migration-only (explains buttons, not sections).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: bible §5.4, yaml `surfaces.inline_help`, `help.ts`, `Tooltip.tsx`, `HelpSpot.tsx`, `HelpCard.tsx`, `HelpOverlay.tsx`.

## 2026-07-03 — Close Pane: two-step visual pane picker (no new button; destructive gets spatial friction)

- **Rule:** The red Close Pane control (inspector `tmux_controls` + native menu) no longer blind-kills the active pane — it arms a transient overlay over the terminal that draws one hit-box per pane from real tmux geometry (cells → %, PaneMapSheet math); hover arms a pane in `danger` red (idle = neutral `accent` marching-ants), click kills exactly it, Esc / scrim cancels, last-pane kill routes through the `confirm()` service. Narrow/touch keeps the old direct-kill (no hover). No new toolbar button.
- **Why:** Blind-kill closed the wrong pane and gave a destructive action zero friction; a spatial two-step pick supplies the friction + `destructive` token + confirmation the rubric wants while adding zero chrome (avoids toolbar-button-creep, the #1 anti-pattern) and reusing the mini-map geometry. Rejected: a dropdown pane list (loses the on-screen spatial mapping); a persistent per-pane close affordance (control creep). Decision 101.
- **Status:** Observed (verified in-browser). Evidence: `ClosePanePicker.tsx`, `close-pane-picker.ts`, `rpc-handlers/tmux-pty.ts` (tmuxKillPane), `TaskTmuxControls.tsx`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-07-03 — Agent picker: Provider → Model → Mode cascade (UI-only grouping, flat `configId` stays the key)

- **Rule:** The launch picker's 3-field cascade is a presentation grouping over the existing flat preset list — the selected leaf resolves to a single `configId`, which stays the durable storage key and command-resolution unit; no data-model decomposition, no migration. Optional `groupLabel?`/`modeLabel?` on `AgentConfiguration` override derivation only when curation beats it. Changing Model preserves the current Mode kind when it exists in the new group (bible §1.0).
- **Why:** Provider matrices are irregular and curated (Codex encodes effort×sandbox in `additionalArgs`, OpenCode's 2nd axis is a persona) — a decomposed `model × mode` cross-product would generate invalid combos, lose per-preset curation, and force a `configId` migration across app versions sharing `~/.dev3.0/` (frozen-layout risk). Rejected: data-model decomposition; optgroup subheaders in one long dropdown (doesn't reduce choice per step).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `LaunchVariantsModal.tsx`, `utils/agentPicker.ts`, `shared/types.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — Mobile terminal input: docked composer default + sticky raw-mode toggle

- **Rule:** On touch in browser mode (gate = `!isElectrobun && isTouchDevice`, NOT width) the terminal never summons the OSK; a docked chat-style composer owns text entry (Send = mode-2004-aware paste + Enter), with a sticky `⌨` raw toggle on `ExtraKeyBar` restoring direct typing. Bible §12.
- **Why:** OSK leaves ~4 terminal rows — compose-then-paste with the tail visible is the converged industry pattern (Termius/Blink/Happy); rejected fullscreen-compose-default (hides the agent's question) and raw-only chrome collapse (typing stays miserable).
- **Status:** Observed (shipped 2026-07-03). Evidence: `TerminalComposer.tsx`, `TerminalView.tsx`, `ExtraKeyBar.tsx`.

## 2026-07-02 — Shared-images re-open control: a Runtime-bar button, not an inspector chip

- **Rule:** Access-to-produced-output controls belong in the inspector's Runtime & access bar (row 2 right); the images button renders only when count > 0 and is a relocation, not an addition. Bible §5.1.
- **Why:** The Context-bar chip read as passive metadata and was undiscoverable; row 2 is the "Outputs" domain (open-in, dev-server) so produced screenshots belong there; rejected duplicating the control (bar creep) and an always-visible disabled button at zero.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02). Evidence: `task-info-panel/TaskSharedImages.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-07-02 — Task image viewer v2: windowed card, fill-to-frame, per-image captions

- **Rule:** The image viewer is a centred windowed modal card (~85vw, fullscreen one keypress away), images fill the frame, tall captures auto-switch to fill-width + vertical scroll, and each `--caption` annotates the image it follows.
- **Why:** A full-bleed takeover didn't read as task-bound and never upscaled small captures; ghostty's WebGL canvas paints above DOM scrims in the desktop shell, so the viewer hides `[data-terminal]` via `visibility:hidden` while open. Decision 097 (addendum).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02, verified in-browser). Evidence: `TaskImageViewer.tsx`, `src/cli/commands/show-image.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — `dev3 show-image` + a task-bound image viewer (new lightbox overlay surface)

- **Rule:** Agent-surfaced images open in a global lightbox overlay (Modal family, not a destination, not the inspector); arrival raises the attention badge + toast, auto-opens only when the user is already focused on that task; a conditional count badge appears next to the diff badge. Bible §5, §12.3.
- **Why:** The missing "agent shows the human a picture" channel; mirrors the diff viewer (task-scoped full surface kept out of nav to protect the ≤7 nav budget and inspector density); files stored in the task worktree (`shared-images/`, additive to the frozen `~/.dev3.0/` layout). Rejected: new destination, inspector tab, toast-only (no history). Decision 097.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-07-02). Evidence: `src/bun/shared-images.ts`, `TaskImageViewer.tsx`, `cli-socket-server.ts`.

## 2026-07-02 — Period navigation on the Velocity Cockpit (temporal nav ≠ a forbidden control)

- **Rule:** The read-only stats cockpit may gain navigation along the time axis (prev/next period stepper; offset ephemeral, lifetime views stay anchored to now) — but never data filters on new dimensions, mutations, or durable config. Bible §1.1, `stats_dashboard.allowed/forbidden`.
- **Why:** Temporal nav extends the existing time-range switch on the same axis (no new control class); rejected a date picker (turns the celebration surface into an operator console).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `stats/PeriodStepper.tsx`, `utils/productivityStats.ts` (`offset`).

## 2026-06-29 — Dashboard Activity: narrow-viewport action sheet (corrects the "OK" verdict)

- **Rule:** On narrow viewports the dashboard project-row action cluster + reorder collapse into a kebab → `BottomSheet`; touch targets ≥44px; no feature may be touch-unreachable. Bible §12.3/§12.6.
- **Why:** Audit showed the "narrow = OK" verdict was wrong: non-wrapping icon row, ~28px targets, reorder fully touch-dead (HTML5 drag + `hidden md:flex` steps); the doctrine's kebab→sheet fixes all three with zero desktop change.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-29). Evidence: `ActivityOverview.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Narrow-viewport tmux windows switcher (pairs with the panes switcher)

- **Rule:** Sub-768px terminals get a windows switcher bar above the panes bar (buttons + dropdown, NO swipe — the pane carousel owns horizontal swipe on that surface), shown only when window count > 1.
- **Why:** Windows were the one terminal affordance with no mobile form (doctrine §4); reuses the panes-switcher idiom; a dedicated `tmuxWindowNavigate` RPC returns layout (same reason `tmuxPaneNavigate` exists). Decision 093.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-29). Evidence: `MobileWindowCarousel.tsx`, `rpc-handlers/tmux-pty.ts`.

## 2026-06-29 — Dev-server button states: green = running only, spinner = transient only

- **Rule:** The `success` green token means a *running* dev server only (configured-but-stopped = neutral); spinners are reserved for transient start/restart; a healthy long-running process shows a calm pulsing dot. Bible §7, §5.1.
- **Why:** The button painted green for any task with a dev script, misusing the token; a perpetual spinner reads as "stuck loading" — the pulsing-dot idiom already used by `BugHuntersLightbox` signals "alive" without anxiety.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped in #754). Evidence: `task-info-panel/TaskDevServer.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Alt/Option-click moves the shell cursor (terminal expert gesture, no chrome)

- **Rule:** Expert pointer gestures layered on the terminal surface add zero chrome (no keymap entry, no menu/setting — a tip is the only discoverability); the shell-vs-TUI decision must live on the backend (tmux `pane_current_command`), never on renderer mouse-tracking state.
- **Why:** dev3's tmux runs `mouse on`, so SGR tracking is always on and the renderer can't distinguish a shell from vim/htop; backend gating keeps the gesture inert in mouse-owning TUIs. Decision 098.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/bun/tmux-alt-click.ts`, `TerminalView.tsx`.

## 2026-06-29 — Instrument & celebrate: countable progress feeds the Velocity Cockpit (standing rule)

- **Rule:** New features producing countable, repeatable signals should emit them into the stats pipeline at build time and surface a cockpit visualization when motivational; the cockpit stays read-only, honest (no backfill, no inflation), and diagnostic metrics stay off it. Bible §1.1, `placement_rules.instrument-and-surface-countable-metrics`.
- **Why:** The cockpit compounds value only if features feed it by default; guardrails (read-only, complexity+honesty budget) prevent it becoming a bloat license.
- **Status:** Proposed (standing practice; cockpit itself Observed).

## 2026-06-28 — Productivity Stats "flair" pass: animations, heatmap, milestones, momentum headline

- **Rule:** The stats showcase may gain motivational polish (boot animations gated by `useReducedMotion`, a range-independent 12-month heatmap, lifetime milestone medals, a momentum headline) but zero new controls; achievement semantics get their own tokens (`--stat-gold`, `--stat-fire`) rather than overloading accent/danger.
- **Why:** Vanity surface — "feel alive and rewarding" is on-brief; a "this week" heatmap is meaningless so the year grid stays range-independent; verifiable logic lives in the pure engine.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-28). Evidence: `utils/productivityStats.ts`, `components/stats/*`.

## 2026-06-28 — Productivity Stats is a new top-level destination, entered from the Dashboard

- **Rule:** A read-only stats screen is a genuine durable place → earns a top-level destination (nav budget stays ≤7); entry via Dashboard card + View menu + ⇧⌘P — explicitly NO GlobalHeader button.
- **Why:** Serves the developer-speed positioning; the user chose the Dashboard card over header chrome; LOC is forward-only (captured at completion, decision 084) so the views show an honest "tracking since". Rejected: a panel inside the Dashboard list, a Settings home.
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-28). Evidence: `ProductivityStatsView.tsx`, `rpc-handlers/productivity-stats.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — `dev3 remote` backgrounds by default (user-first CLI default)

- **Rule:** Hand-typed CLI commands default to what a lazy human wants (detach + print link + return the shell); machine/supervised callers (systemd, Docker, skills) pay the explicit `--no-detach`. Bible §1.0.
- **Why:** The Unix foreground-daemon convention optimizes for supervisors, but the primary caller here is a human; rejected keeping foreground default (taxes the human to please a convention that doesn't bind them).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/cli/commands/remote.ts`, `remote-service.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — Browser-mode application menu bar (the native menu's stand-in in Remote Access)

- **Rule:** Browser mode renders its own `AppMenuBar` above `GlobalHeader`, built from the SAME `buildApplicationMenu` source as the native menu (relocated to `src/shared/`) — one definition, no RPC, no drift; items not covered by `menuRouter` browser handlers are dropped; labels stay English (documented exception). Never mounted in Electrobun.
- **Why:** Remote mode lost the canonical action surface; a fresh top strip adds zero pressure to the dense header cluster; rejected merging into `GlobalHeader`, a `getApplicationMenu` RPC, and duplicating the menu (guaranteed drift).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/shared/application-menu.ts`, `AppMenuBar.tsx`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-06-28 — Narrow-viewport (mobile) doctrine: carousel/one-at-a-time everywhere

- **Rule:** On sub-768px show exactly one sibling at a time with swipe + visible pager; gate layout on reactive `useNarrowViewport(768)` (never `isElectrobun`, never mount-once `useMobile`); full-surface swipe only on scroll-body surfaces (never live-content like terminals/diffs); every swipe has button+keyboard equivalents; `BottomSheet` is the mandated mobile action surface; no feature may be touch-unreachable. Bible §12 + yaml `responsive`.
- **Why:** Phone-over-remote is the real secondary form factor; generalising the proven board carousel avoids forking a separate mobile app; the breakpoint reconciliation fixed a real 1024-vs-768 doc/code mismatch.
- **Status:** Observed (board + terminal + header + inspector shipped; rest tracked per-surface in yaml `surface_adaptation`).

## 2026-06-28 — Remote Access modal: network-interface (IP) selector, tunnel-off only

- **Rule:** When the tunnel is off, a styled native `<select>` above the URL block lists candidate IPv4s (+ loopback) and rebuilds URL/QR; hidden when the tunnel is on; requested host validated against the enumerated allow-list; session-local.
- **Why:** Auto-picking one interface breaks on multi-homed boxes (VPN/Docker/multiple NICs) and blocks the SSH-forward `localhost` path; configuration inside an existing modal = no new surface; native `<select>` reuses the `ProjectSettings` pattern and is not a banned OS dialog.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `remote-access-server.ts`, `rpc-handlers/remote-access.ts` (`host` param).

## 2026-06-27 — Global keyboard focus ring (`:focus-visible`) as the single focus affordance

- **Rule:** One global `:focus-visible` accent outline in `index.css` (keyboard/AT only, never mouse), authored after `@tailwind utilities`; modal shells (`[tabindex="-1"]`) exempted. **Specificity trap: `focus:outline-none` is banned.** Tailwind compiles it to `.focus\:outline-none:focus` at specificity (0,2,0), which beats the global `:focus-visible` rule at (0,1,0) regardless of source order and silently kills the keyboard ring. Bare `outline-none` (0,1,0) is fine — it loses on source order.
- **Why:** App-wide ring belongs in the base stylesheet; the `focus:outline-none` trap was identified as a shipped regression vector (see §9a.1). Rejected: per-component Tailwind ring classes; a new focus token (accent already is the focus color).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-27). Evidence: `src/mainview/index.css`, `DESIGN.md`.

## 2026-06-24 — Built-in Operations board: pinned-first, ⌘0, and a "system object" identity

- **Rule:** The built-in Operations board (`kind: "virtual"` + `builtin: true`) is pinned first everywhere (`orderProjectsForDisplay`), owns `⌘0` (excluded from ⌘1-9; zoom-reset moved to ⇧⌘0), and reads as a system object (bracketed localized name + ⚡ + SYSTEM badge) — no new object, destination, or color token.
- **Why:** Structurally special (app-provisioned, undeletable) so it must not read as "just another project"; bracketed-name treatment chosen over a new violet token to avoid theme churn; virtual tasks drop Git/Dev-Server/Scripts inspector controls (net budget reduction).
- **Status:** Observed (2026-06-24). Evidence: `shared/types.ts` (`isBuiltinOpsProject`), `App.tsx`, `ActivityOverview.tsx`.

## 2026-06-23 — Virtual "Operations" board: repo-less ad-hoc work as `Project.kind: "virtual"`

- **Rule:** Repo-less work is a new *kind* of the existing Project object — same dashboard/board/cards/labels stack, git domain hidden entirely, simplified columns; virtual projects live in a separate `~/.dev3.0/virtual-projects.json` (parallel-path rule 5) with synthetic never-reused `~/.dev3.0/ops/<slug>` paths so `projectSlug()`/CLI context stay untouched; working dir is a managed temp folder by default.
- **Why:** A new kind keeps IA/nav/components unchanged while switching git off where meaningless; rejected a new top-level nav entry, a parallel Workspace object (~90% overlap), and a no-worktree flag inside git projects (breaks diff/PR semantics). Directory hidden by default to kill the onboarding problem.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped 2026-06-23 in 6 stages; replaced `home-terminal`, ⇧⌘` = Quick-shell operation). Full spec in git history.

## 2026-06-22 — Feature-discovery tips are surface-aware and distributed beyond the board

- **Rule:** Tips carry a required `contexts` field used as a sort *boost, never a filter* (matching tips lead, then the full catalogue cycles); the `ActiveTasksSidebar` is the tip carrier for the task/terminal view via the shared `useTipRotation` hook.
- **Why:** Tips previously reached only the Kanban board, so terminal-surface discovery facts never reached terminal dwellers; boost-not-filter keeps every surface cycling everything. Rejected: a ticker (annoying), a permanent terminal footer (chrome creep), an exclusive-context flag.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `tips.ts` (`TipContext`), `hooks/useTipRotation.ts`.

## 2026-07-11 — Active Tasks sidebar: readiness tiers + visible priority (supersedes 2026-06-22)

- **Rule:** The sidebar groups by **readiness tier** — `NEEDS YOU` (review-by-user ∪ user-questions ∪ *signalled* review-by-colleague) → custom columns (project order) → `WAITING` (in-progress ∪ review-by-ai ∪ unsignalled review-by-colleague) — not by status; within every tier it sorts by priority band P0→P4, then oldest `movedAt`, then `seq`. Each card shows the kanban's `PriorityBadge` (picker → `setTaskPriority`) + a compact status label; the attention/bell scope is the `NEEDS YOU` tier at global breadth with the same sort. Grouping+sort is a pure function (`groupTasksIntoTiers`).
- **Why:** A work queue must first answer "does this need me?" then "how important?"; a live PR signal is the only status whose tier is runtime-driven, and manual custom-column parking must outrank a merely-busy agent. Rejected: keep per-status groups (priority already sorts within them, but the user can't see priority and can't tell actionable from churning). Supersedes the 2026-06-22 oldest-first-uniform rule (priority now leads; oldest-`movedAt` is the in-band tiebreak).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `sidebarTiers.ts` (+`__tests__`), `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`; `decisions/2026/07/11/sidebar-readiness-tiers.md`.

## 2026-06-21 — Hint navigation is a cross-surface primitive; keyboard-first expert layer

- **Rule:** The Vimium-style `HintOverlay` is surface-agnostic (scans `[data-hint-id]` on the innermost clickable element); hints map to navigation/open destinations only — never mutations or destructive actions; bare/sequence keys match on `e.code` (layout-independent).
- **Why:** Generalizing the existing overlay avoids per-surface clones; `e.key` matching made the feature Latin-layout-only (the real bug); `g`-prefix go-to + `/` + `c` follow Linear/GitHub conventions. Decision 076.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `HintOverlay.tsx`, `utils/hintLabels.ts`, `App.tsx`.

## 2026-06-19 — Diff review is a 3-day persisted safety net + explicit "Reset review"

- **Rule:** Inline diff reviews persist in `localStorage` with a 3-day TTL (safety net, not a store); clipboard is transport only; `Reset review` is destructive-styled, confirm-gated, visible only with ≥1 comment; the whole review lifecycle stays inside the diff viewer surface (documented as bible §5.2).
- **Why:** Reviews previously lived in volatile clipboard + React state and were lost to accidental terminal selections; permanent storage was over-scoped (stale accumulation) — 3 days covers the realistic re-copy window; a backend file store rejected (RPC plumbing + touching the frozen `~/.dev3.0/` zone for ephemeral drafts).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (`pruneExpiredReviews`).

## 2026-06-19 — Keyboard-shortcut registry as single source of truth + two-tab reference overlay

- **Rule:** `src/mainview/keymap.ts` is the single source of truth for app-level shortcuts (drives the two-tab App|Terminal `KeyboardShortcutsModal`, README, website); the registry documents — the `App.tsx` handler chain stays the dispatcher; entry via Help menu + ⌘/ + palette, never a toolbar button or nav destination.
- **Why:** Registry-driven dispatch was rejected as a risky rewrite of edge-case-heavy central code (capture phase, terminal focus, `e.code`); a vitest test guards drift instead; ⌘/ over bare `?` because the live terminal must still receive `?`.
- **Status:** Observed (shipped; also codified in AGENTS.md). Evidence: `keymap.ts`, `KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx`, `__tests__/keymap.test.ts`.

## 2026-06-19 — Both palettes surfaced in the native View menu (discoverability)

- **Rule:** Keyboard-only surfaces still get native-menu entries (the menu is the canonical action surface); chord accelerators can't be bound in Electrobun (single-char only, decision 044) so the chord is shown in the label text and the keydown handlers stay the sole shortcut owners.
- **Why:** A native accelerator would double-fire against the toggle handlers. Decision 074.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `application-menu.ts`, `menuRouter.ts`.

## 2026-06-18 — Action palette (⇧⌘P): two-surfaces-one-shell; DOM mirror of the native menu

- **Rule:** Navigation (⌘K) and actions (⇧⌘P) are two surfaces on one extracted `PaletteShell`; the action palette runs commands via the existing `handleMenuAction` router (a mirror, not a second command runner); destructive lifecycle + modal flows are excluded by policy (destructive needs friction, not fuzzy-Enter); language-switch labels stay identical across locales so English is always findable.
- **Why:** VSCode's chord convention; routing through `handleMenuAction` also fixed several previously-inert native menu items. Decision 072.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `CommandPaletteModal.tsx`, `commands.ts`, `PaletteShell.tsx`.

## 2026-06-18 — Command palette (⌘K) introduced as a new surface

- **Rule:** ⌘K is the type-to-find navigation surface (keyboard-only, zero visible chrome — no toolbar-creep); short UI entities must reuse `utils/fuzzyMatch.ts` as the single matcher (BM25 stays for long transcripts only); ⌘K = navigation, ⇧⌘P = actions, kept separate.
- **Why:** `Cmd+T` rejected — universal "new tab" and intercepted by the live terminal; ⌘K is the Slack/Linear/Notion convention. Distinct from the Option+Tab switcher (MRU over *active* tasks vs type-search over all entities).
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `ProjectQuickSwitchModal.tsx`, `utils/fuzzyMatch.ts`.

## 2026-06-15 — Option+Tab task switcher is a transient HUD overlay, NOT a command palette

- **Rule:** The task switcher is an `expert_shortcut` rendering the existing `task_jump` action class as a hold-cycle HUD (Option+Tab project / Option+Shift+Tab global; Ctrl+Tab on Linux); MRU in-memory order; live Shift scope toggle; commit respects `dev3-task-open-mode`.
- **Why:** A command palette was rejected — the sidebar already owns `task_jump` and a new global palette would be surface creep; MRU matches the alt-tab muscle memory the user explicitly invoked. Decision 069.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskSwitcherOverlay.tsx`.

## 2026-06-16 — Browser-style back/forward navigation in the global header

- **Rule:** History arrows live at the far LEFT of the header breadcrumb row (navigation belongs with the "address bar", not the action cluster), as a segmented pill of two icon-only chevrons; ⌘[/⌘] + mouse side buttons drive the existing `state.ts` route-history stack.
- **Why:** Bare chevrons didn't read as a control (looked decorative); the segmented group is the universal back/forward affordance; far-left placement adds zero pressure to the dense right cluster. History dropdown rejected as scope creep.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `state.ts`.

## 2026-06-15 — Compact status-age badge on Active Tasks sidebar cards

- **Rule:** Status-age is a read-only `status` indicator (consumes no action budget): clock glyph + single most-significant unit (`5m`/`7h`/`13d`), live 1s re-render, verbose form in the tooltip only.
- **Why:** `movedAt` is written only on real status changes so it faithfully means "time in current status"; compact-only per the user's requirement.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `utils/statusAge.ts`, `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`.

## 2026-06-15 — Cmd+Shift+1..9 switches project to the OPPOSITE view

- **Rule:** Shift = inverse of the unshifted chord: ⌘1-9 preserves view mode, ⇧⌘1-9 flips it (and deliberately ignores `dev3-task-open-mode` — explicit Shift means "the other view"). Not in the app menu (chord accelerators impossible, decision 044).
- **Why:** One-chord "reach a project AND the other layout"; macOS swallows ⇧⌘3/4/5 for screenshots — documented, not worked around. Decision 068.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `App.tsx`.

## 2026-06-12 — Quiet "behind origin" indicator on the header Git Pull button

- **Rule:** Header convention: *quiet* accent (icon tint + 6px dot) for ambient "something is available"; *loud* accent (filled pill + pulse) reserved for app-update prompts. Status indicators don't consume the header action budget.
- **Why:** Behind-origin is a status, not an action; backend `fetchOrigin` is throttled (3 min) so the 15s poll stays network-free.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `GitPullButton.tsx`, `git.ts` (`getBehindOriginCount`).

## 2026-06-11 — Slash skill autocomplete in the new-task description

- **Rule:** Input assists (inline autocomplete anchored to the field) are zero-chrome and consume no surface budget; a dedicated "insert X" button would be toolbar creep.
- **Why:** Users invoke skills by `/name` and shouldn't memorize slugs; caret-anchored positioning rejected as needless complexity for a 4-row textarea.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `useSkillAutocomplete.ts`, `SkillAutocompleteDropdown.tsx`, `src/bun/skills-catalog.ts`.

## 2026-06-10 — AI-initiated task completion uses a blocking, visually distinct confirm dialog

- **Rule:** Agent-requested completion opens the imperative `confirm()` modal with an `agentInitiated` treatment (accent border + "AI agent request" badge, danger-role confirm, autofocused cancel); the CLI blocks ≤10 min; decline = exit code 6; `cancelled` stays CLI-forbidden.
- **Why:** Completion destroys the worktree + tmux session (destructive → human approval); the AI-identity badge prevents mistaking it for a routine confirm. Zero new chrome. Decision 067.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `confirm.tsx`, `completion-requests.ts`, `cli-socket-server.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — Narrow-viewport carousel navigation (mobile / remote)

- **Rule:** Narrow viewports get a responsive *view-mode* of existing screens, never a new destination: board = 2D scroll-snap carousel (full-surface swipe OK — column bodies scroll only vertically); terminal = pane carousel with an explicit pager (NO full-pane swipe — TUIs consume touch); gate on width, not `isElectrobun`.
- **Why:** "One screen-width element + swipe to siblings" is presentation of data the screens already own (bible §4); tmux auto-unzooms on pane select so steps must `select-pane` then re-zoom. Idea by Ittai Zeidman.
- **Status:** Observed (board + pane carousels shipped). Evidence: `MobileBoardCarousel.tsx`, `MobilePaneCarousel.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — Cmd+1..9 preserves the current view mode (task-view vs board)

- **Rule:** Project switching preserves the user's view mode (task view → task view with an explicit "select a task" empty state; board → board); the empty state is a status surface (centered muted text, no button, no auto-selected task).
- **Why:** Keyboard-heavy users live in the task view; yanking to the board on every switch breaks flow; auto-selecting a task was explicitly rejected — the user asked for an empty pane, not a guess.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `App.tsx`, `ProjectView.tsx`, `state.ts` (`taskView`).

## 2026-06-03 — Prevent-sleep surfaced as a header toggle with a new `--awake` token

- **Rule:** Prevent-sleep is an always-visible header toggle (coffee glyph, semantic `--awake` amber token in both themes), forced on + locked while remote access is active; enabled = sleep inhibited whole-app-lifetime, not just while agents run.
- **Why:** Buried in Settings it was invisible; amber/coffee reads "awake" and is distinct from `--warning`; remote-active detection imported lazily to keep the resource monitor free of electrobun-heavy imports.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `PreventSleepToggle.tsx`, `caffeinate.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — TaskInfoPanel governed by a 4-bar 2×2 domain model

- **Rule:** The inspector header is a 2×2 grid of quickbars, one per domain — Context / Session-Agent (row 1 = "Drive"), Git / Runtime (row 2 = "Outputs"); panel chrome pinned far-right of row 1 is not a bar; labels truncate to 4 chips + `+k`. Bible §5.1.
- **Why:** Row-1-right had become a 4-domain dumpster; the panel has a hard `MAX_RATIO=0.33` height budget, so domains separate horizontally, not by adding rows.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — macOS dock-persistence + React quit-confirmation modal

- **Rule:** Standard macOS lifecycle (`exitOnLastWindowClosed: false`; closing windows ≠ quitting); one React quit-confirmation modal (never `showMessageBox`) driven by a single `before-quit` gate on every deliberate quit; a window-less quit reopens a window that pulls the pending dialog on mount.
- **Why:** The dialog must work identically in the remote client; the pull-on-mount handshake fixed a push-vs-mount race. Decisions 044/060/061.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `quit-manager.ts`, `App.tsx`, `src/bun/index.ts`.

## 2026-06-03 — Hide-sidebar affordance inside the Active Tasks sidebar header

- **Rule:** Controls that govern a panel (chrome) sit at the panel-chrome convention's far-right edge; the sidebar header follows the toolbar budget (≤4 visible), not the §5.1 bar model.
- **Why:** The split could only be collapsed from the top-right; the sidebar needed its own affordance, mirroring the inspector's zoom toggle.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`.

## 2026-06-03 — Compact (≤1600px) layout for header + task toolbar

- **Rule:** Below 1600px (`useCompact()`), header/toolbar labels collapse to icon-only (tooltips kept) and the rare external links fold into a single `⋯` overflow; no flex-wrap (vertical space is scarce in a terminal-centric app).
- **Why:** 14" MacBooks overflowed the labelled rows; per the action taxonomy, rare external links are the correct overflow candidates. Content-aware (ResizeObserver) v2 noted. Decision 063.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `useCompact.ts`, `GlobalHeader.tsx`.

## 2026-05-29 — Toolbar button creep flagged as the primary anti-pattern

- **Rule:** Explicit complexity budgets; adding a visible button to `TaskInfoPanel`, `TaskCard`, or board toolbars requires an overflow/group decision first.
- **Why:** Changelog history showed steady accretion of always-visible git/tmux/dev-server buttons on the densest surfaces.
- **Status:** Inferred (from changelog + file sizes) — now enforced by the budgets in yaml.

## 2026-05-29 — Native application menu is the canonical action surface

- **Rule:** The Electrobun application menu is the authoritative, complete action taxonomy; DOM toolbars mirror only the frequent subset.
- **Why:** The menu enumerates every action; DOM surfaces are intentionally partial to control density.
- **Status:** Observed. Evidence: `src/shared/application-menu.ts`.

## 2026-08-03 — Task card is governed by five zones, and the left rail owns lifecycle

- **Rule:** The board card is a 3px status strip + a full-width identity header + a 20px vertical lifecycle rail (44px on touch) (status control) + a body whose segmented bottom bar carries grouped signals above a reserved action strip; each zone has one admission rule (`surfaces.task_card.zone_model`).
- **Why:** Nothing was zoned, so every feature added a badge row and the status control — the most important button on the card — read as a text label; the rejected alternative was a right-hand indicator rail (constant height, but a bare counter hides severity).
- **Status:** Implemented. Evidence: `src/mainview/components/TaskCard.tsx`, `src/mainview/components/TaskCardRail.tsx`.

## 2026-05-29 — Button variants documented as role → token, not as a prop

- **Rule:** Button semantics are documented as semantic role mapped to Tailwind token classes (`bg-accent` = primary, `text-danger`/`bg-danger` = destructive, ghost = hover surface) — there is no `<Button variant>` API.
- **Why:** No formal Button component exists; AGENTS.md forbids hardcoded colors and mandates semantic tokens.
- **Status:** Observed.

## 2026-05-29 — Initial manifest derived from repository

- **Rule:** dev-3.0 is a full-screen desktop web app with a screen-based navigation model (the `Route` union in `state.ts`); the manifest's "routes" are screen ids.
- **Why:** There is no URL router; modeling `useReducer` navigation as URL routes would be fiction.
- **Status:** Observed.
