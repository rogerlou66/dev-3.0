# Product UX Bible — dev-3.0

Status: Draft (initial)
Source: Derived from repository audit

Owner: Product UX Architecture

Evidence notation: `Observed` (backed by code/docs), `Inferred` (likely rule from repeated patterns), `Proposed` (recommended, not yet consistent), `Unknown` (insufficient evidence).

## 1. Purpose

Canonical UX architecture reference for dev-3.0. It defines how the app organizes navigation, screens, surfaces, actions, and design-token roles, and where new features should live. Agents must consult this (via the `ux-principal` skill) before adding UI.

### 1.0 North-star principle — the user is the star; optimize for the lazy human — `Observed`

**When a default, shape, or amount-of-typing trades off the human's effort against a machine's, always favor the human.** The user is a person — lazy by design, and rightly so: they should type/click the minimum and get the obvious, most-wanted outcome. Agents, scripts, CI, and supervisors are not — they can happily emit a longer command with explicit flags, read a man page, or carry extra config. So:

- **Defaults serve the human's most common intent**, even if that diverges from a machine-world convention. Example: `dev3 remote` (a hand-typed command) **backgrounds by default** because "start it and give me my shell back" is what a person wants — Docker/nginx default to foreground, but a human typing the command is not Docker. The foreground/supervised path is the one that pays the extra `--no-detach` flag, because the thing that needs it (systemd, a Docker `CMD`, a script) is a machine and doesn't mind the verbosity. See `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-28, detach-by-default).
- **Push required verbosity onto the non-human caller**, never onto the person. If exactly one side must say more, make it the agent/script/supervisor.
- This applies to CLI defaults, flag polarity (prefer `--no-x` opt-outs over `--x` opt-ins when the human wants `x` by default), prefilled form values, smart defaults in dialogs, and "do the obvious thing on Enter."
- It does **not** mean hiding power or breaking safety: destructive/irreversible actions still demand explicit confirmation (the human's effort there is the point). It means the *happy, safe, common* path is the lazy path.

Litmus test when choosing a default or flag polarity: *"who is typing this, and what do they most want with the fewest keystrokes?"* If the answer is "a human, who wants X" — make X the default and let machines opt out.

### 1.1 Instrument & celebrate — countable progress feeds the Velocity Cockpit — `Proposed`

**dev-3.0 ships a surface whose entire job is to make shipping *feel* rewarding — the read-only Productivity Stats / Velocity Cockpit (`stats`).** People love a number that ticks up; the cockpit is where the product turns raw activity into motivation. Treat it as a first-class consumer of every new feature, not an afterthought.

- **Instrument by default.** When a feature produces a *countable, repeatable* signal (a thing shipped, a run completed, a streak, a volume, a milestone crossed), emit that signal into the stats pipeline **at build time** — extend the `getProductivityStats` event shape (`src/bun/rpc-handlers/productivity-stats.ts`) and/or the pure aggregation engine (`src/mainview/utils/productivityStats.ts`) — rather than bolting analytics on months later. The data should *exist* even if you don't draw a chart for it yet.
- **Then surface it — selectively.** If the metric is *motivational* (progress, momentum, achievement, milestone), add a visualization to the cockpit. If it is merely *diagnostic*, keep the data but do **not** clutter the cockpit with it.

**Guardrails — this is not a license to dump every counter onto one screen:**
- The cockpit is **read-only**. Never add a **data filter** (slicing by project/agent/label — a new dimension beyond the time axis), durable config, or any mutation there (`ux-architecture.yaml surfaces.stats_dashboard.forbidden`). It celebrates; it does not operate. **Permitted exception — temporal navigation of the existing time range:** the prev/next period stepper (browse past days/weeks/months) is an *extension of the time-range switch on the same axis*, not a new control class — it stays read-only, its offset is ephemeral (not persisted), and it adds no new data dimension. Time is the one axis the cockpit already governs; navigating along it is allowed, filtering across new ones is not.
- Respect a **complexity + honesty budget**. Prefer one strong motivational signal over five weak ones; consolidate; a new metric must *earn* its place. A wall of near-zero gauges is worse than no gauge.
- **Forward-only honesty.** If a signal only starts being recorded now, show an honest "tracking since" / empty-state treatment (as the LOC views do) — never backfill fake history or imply data you don't have.
- **Motivational ≠ vanity-at-any-cost.** The number must be *true*. Don't inflate or double-count to look impressive — a dishonest cockpit destroys the trust that makes it motivating.

Litmus test when shipping a feature: *"does this produce something countable a developer would be proud to watch tick up?"* If yes — emit the data now, and surface it on the cockpit when it motivates. See §5 (Productivity Stats surface), §9 (budgets), §10 (placement rules), and `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-29).

## 2. Product overview

### Product type — `Observed`

- **App type:** Full-screen desktop web app. Electrobun shell (Bun main process) renders a React 19 + Tailwind + Vite webview. Not Electron, not a website.
- **Primary users:** Developers running multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor) across many tasks; terminal-centric power users.
- **Primary jobs:** create a task → get an isolated git worktree + tmux terminal with a preconfigured agent; track tasks on a Kanban board; run git/PR/dev-server operations per task; manage multiple git-repo projects with lifecycle scripts.
- **Operating mode:** Long-lived window, keyboard-heavy, many concurrent terminals. Density is expected and tolerated by the audience — but not unlimited (see budgets).

Evidence: `concept.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `src/mainview/state.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`.

### Known gaps

- No URL routing — navigation is a screen-based `Route` union (`src/mainview/state.ts`).
- No formal `<Button variant>` component — buttons are inline-styled with semantic tokens.
- No multi-select / bulk-action model on the board (per-task actions only).
- No dedicated `--info` semantic token (accent/blue is reused).

## 3. Object model — `Observed`

| Object | Route (screen) | Detail | Owner | Common actions | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project | `dashboard` | `project` | workspace | add, clone, open settings, reorder, remove, pull main | `types.ts (Project)`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `ProjectSettings.tsx` |
| Project (kind: virtual) | `dashboard` (badged) | `project` | workspace | add (Operations), open, rename, remove | `types.ts (Project.kind)`, `AddProjectModal.tsx`, `data.ts (addVirtualProject)` |
| Task | `project` (card) | `task` (full terminal) / split in `project` | project | create, move status, rename, set overview, note, spawn variants, add attempts, duplicate, delete, watch, open-in, git, dev-server | `types.ts (Task)`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `application-menu.ts` |
| Label | — (overlay on tasks) | — | project | create, rename, recolor, assign, filter | `types.ts (Label)`, `LabelPicker.tsx`, `LabelFilterBar.tsx` |
| Custom Column | — (board column) | — | project | create, rename, recolor, set LLM instruction, attach agent | `types.ts (CustomColumn)`, `KanbanBoard.tsx` |
| Note | — (clamped preview in inspector → own overlay) | — | task | add, edit, delete | `types.ts (TaskNote)`, `NoteItem.tsx`, `task-info-panel/TaskNotes.tsx`, `TaskNotesOverlay.tsx` |
| HTML Artifact | — (conditional Runtime-bar entry; enumerated rows in the archived task modal) | docked/fullscreen task workspace | task | view, resize, fullscreen, navigate history, find in content (⌘F), download HTML/ZIP bundle, open in web browser | `types.ts (SharedArtifact)`, `TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `show-artifact.ts` |
| Automation | — (managed in `project-settings` tab `automations`) | — | project | create, edit, enable/disable, run now, view run history, delete | `types.ts (Automation)`, `ProjectSettings.tsx`, `automations-scheduler.ts` |

**Automation (`Observed`, 2026-07-05):** a per-project scheduled agent run — an RFC 5545 RRULE subset + IANA timezone, a stored prompt, and an agent choice. When a schedule fires (bun-process scheduler, runs in desktop **and** `dev3 remote` headless), it creates an **ordinary task** (worktree + tmux + agent, prompt = task description) on the board — automations never grow their own board, destination, or task list. Provenance: the created task records its `automationId` and the card shows a small clock glyph; run history (fired / task created / missed while app was offline) is persisted per automation and shown only inside the Automations tab. Missed runs are surfaced (toast + per-automation status), never silently skipped. A built-in **"What I shipped" report template** pre-fills the create form; the resulting digest is again just a task. CLI: `dev3 automations …`.

Task lifecycle states (`ALL_STATUSES`): `todo`, `in-progress`, `user-questions`, `review-by-ai`, `review-by-user`, `review-by-colleague`, `completed`, `cancelled`. Most transitions are hook-driven, not manual.

**Project kind (`Observed`, 2026-06-23):** `Project.kind` is `git` (default) or `virtual`. A **virtual "Operations" board** is the same Project object class — it reuses the dashboard, board, cards, sidebar, labels, and notes — but its tasks run an agent + a split-right shell in a managed temp folder (or a chosen one) with **no git worktree**; the entire git domain (branch/diff/PR/push/merge/rebase, the inspector Git bar, and all three review columns) is hidden, leaving `todo → in-progress → user-questions → completed/cancelled`. One built-in board ships by default and hosts the **Quick-shell** operation (⇧⌘`), which replaced the former single home terminal. See decision 079 + feature plan.

**Project sensitivity (`Proposed`, 2026-08-05):** `Project.sensitive` is a **property of the project**, in the same class as `Task.draft` / `Task.hibernated` — never a column, a kind, or an action. It is inert on its own: it changes nothing until streamer mode is on, and then it changes three things at once — the project's name and its tasks are masked wherever they render, the project cannot be entered, and no notification from it reaches the user. It is the only property that is allowed to refuse a route (§10 privacy-sensitive object row).

## 4. Navigation model — `Observed`

The app uses a **screen router** (`Route` union + `useReducer` with a 15-entry back/forward history), not URLs.

### Global navigation

Destinations: `dashboard`, `project` (Kanban — the daily home), `task`, `project-terminal`, `settings`, `project-settings`, `changelog`, `stats` (Productivity Stats / Velocity Cockpit). Debug-only: `gauge-demo`, `viewport-lab`.

Mechanism: `GlobalHeader` breadcrumbs (`Dashboard > Project > Task`) + back/forward + native application-menu `View`.

- **Allowed:** stable destinations, workspaces, major product areas.
- **Forbidden:** one-off actions, filters, temporary state, object-specific controls.
- **Budget:** ≤ 7 top-level destinations, max depth 2. Debug screens stay menu-only.

### Breadcrumbs — `Observed`

Show location only. Text click navigates; the project chevron opens a **project-switcher dropdown**. No commands in breadcrumbs. The task segment also carries the passive **native-backend marker** (§5.6) — identity, not an action.

Evidence: `GlobalHeader.tsx`.

### Tabs — `Observed`

Tabs divide sibling views inside an existing destination. Observed in `dashboard` (`Board | Projects`) and `project-settings` (`global | project | worktree | automations`). Budget ≤ 6 visible tabs. Dashboard Board may use one trailing search field in this row because it filters only the active workspace board; it disappears on Projects and flexes before displacing either tab.

### Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K nav · Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P actions) — `Observed`

A keyboard-summoned palette with **two modes on one shared shell** (`PaletteShell`). **Cmd+K** = navigation: fuzzy-jump to a project, Enter navigates (complements `Cmd+1..9` and the breadcrumb dropdown). **Cmd+Shift+P** = actions: fuzzy-match a command label, Enter runs it via `handleMenuAction` — a DOM mirror of the native menu, not a second command runner; only context-applicable commands show. Both fuzzy via `utils/fuzzyMatch.ts`. Destructive (delete/cancel/complete) and modal/inline flows (rename, overview, note, spawn, duplicate) are excluded from the quick palette by policy. See Surface model below.

## 5. Surface model — `Observed` unless noted

| Surface | Purpose | Allowed | Forbidden | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Global header | Location + switching + app utilities | breadcrumb, destination, project switcher, settings/changelog entry, tmux manager, prevent-sleep (awake) toggle, **≤1 ambient resource readout** (memory headroom) | task-scoped action, dense filters, destructive primary | `GlobalHeader.tsx` |
| Application menu (native) | Canonical home for the full action taxonomy | every action type | — | `application-menu.ts`, `menu-actions.ts` |
| Workspace board | Cross-project daily work on the Dashboard Board tab | project swimlanes, aligned lifecycle columns, task open/move, search | cross-project task moves, project-specific column configuration | `WorkspaceBoard.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx` |
| Kanban board | Primary single-project work surface | task cards, create-in-column, drag-move, column config, task filter (token-DSL search + funnel; label chips are a view of it) | durable global config | `KanbanBoard.tsx`, `KanbanColumn.tsx`, `LabelFilterBar.tsx`, `FilterFunnel.tsx` |
| Task card | Compact task summary | status dot, labels, variant dots (≤3, clickable → sibling popover), open, context menu, git badge, native-backend marker (§5.6) | full settings, global destination, unbounded dot rows | `TaskCard.tsx` (large — watch density) |
| Task info panel (inspector) | Active-task control: git, dev server, scripts, notes, tmux, open-in | object/git/dev-server actions, metadata, **capped** notes preview (§5.8) | global destination, cross-project action, an uncapped note list | `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` (densest surface) |
| Task notes log | The whole agent-written note log of one task | read every note, add, edit, delete | task lifecycle action, git mutation, global destination | `TaskNotesOverlay.tsx` (sheet on narrow, dialog on wide — see 5.8) |
| Terminal immersive fullscreen | Ephemeral task-bound terminal workspace for focused tmux work | tmux terminal, existing tmux window/pane controls, `dev3` brand, one wide Exit full screen action | global/app header, task switching UI, inspector controls, route persistence, any tmux pane/layout mutation | `App.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` |
| Diff review viewer | Full-screen read + inline-review of a task's diff | view-mode toggle, file-tree nav, search, mark-read, per-file copy-path, inline comments, review export/copy/reset | task lifecycle action, git mutation, global destination | `TaskDiffViewer.tsx` (see 5.3) |
| Task image viewer | Task-bound lightbox for images an agent surfaced via `dev3 show-image` (history rail, newest first) | image display, history nav (thumbnails + prev/next + arrows), copy image, reveal path, clear (destructive) | global destination, task lifecycle/git mutation, persistent inspector button (badge is conditional), SVG render (v1) | `TaskImageViewer.tsx` (planned; see UX_DECISIONS 2026-07-02) |
| Task artifact workspace | Task-bound interactive HTML plus explicit local CSS/JS/raster assets surfaced via `dev3 show-artifact`; docked beside the terminal, resizable, fullscreen on demand | sandboxed display, history nav, theme sync, floating ⌘F find over the content (§10), network integrations, HTML/ZIP download, open in the OS web browser (§10) | global destination, task lifecycle/git mutation, parent DOM/RPC access, native dialog (trusted scripts can self-navigate their iframe) | `TaskArtifactViewer.tsx`, `TaskWorkspacePane.tsx`, `shared-artifacts.ts` |

**Archived tasks reach their agent outputs through enumerated rows, not the Runtime bar (`Observed`, 2026-08-08).** A completed/cancelled task has no Runtime bar and no workspace pane, so `TaskDetailModal`'s archived view lists every `dev3 show-image` image and `dev3 show-artifact` artifact as its own clickable row (`SharedOutputsList.tsx`), above Notes: the deliverable outranks the commentary. Rows open the App-hosted viewers at their own index — the artifact viewer as a **standalone overlay** (fullscreen forced, no dock-back toggle) since there is no pane to dock into. Both viewers register in the overlay-layer stack, so Escape unwinds viewer → modal instead of closing the modal underneath.
| Modal | Focused create/confirm | create flow, confirm, focused config | navigation, persistent dashboard | `*Modal.tsx` |
| Popover | Contextual preview/hint | preview, hint, quick action, remediation | multi-step flow, primary destination | `*Popover.tsx` |
| Context menu | Right-click object actions | object action, open-in, destructive | global destination | `OpenInMenu.tsx` |
| Settings | Durable configuration | configuration, preference, integration, scripts | daily operational action | `GlobalSettings.tsx`, `ProjectSettings.tsx` |
| Sidebar | Active-task jump list (readiness-tier work queue: NEEDS YOU = Your Review, Has Questions, PR Review → custom columns → WAITING = Agent is Working, AI Review; priority-sorted). Row zones mirror the Kanban card: LIFECYCLE rail → title → signals → muted identity line | destination, task jump, **lifecycle move + quick-complete (shared `TaskCardRail`, `autoLabel` form, §9)**, priority re-order (badge picker), terminal preview, search + token-DSL task filter (funnel, active-statuses pool), variant dots (≤3, clickable → sibling popover), native-backend marker (§5.6) | durable config, action strip, git/dev-server action | `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`, `ActiveTaskRow.tsx`, `TaskCardRail.tsx`, `sidebarTiers.ts`, `FilterFunnel.tsx` |
| Command palette (Cmd+K nav / Cmd+Shift+P actions) | Type-to-find nav + type-to-run commands (two modes, one shell) | destination, fuzzy search, object jump, command runner (action mode, via handleMenuAction) | destructive action, modal/inline flow, durable config without friction, dense filters | `PaletteShell.tsx`, `ProjectQuickSwitchModal.tsx`, `CommandPaletteModal.tsx`, `commands.ts` |
| Keyboard-shortcuts overlay | Read-only keymap reference (App + Terminal tabs) | grouped shortcut rows, tab switch | action runner, durable config, nav destination | `KeyboardShortcutsModal` (planned), `TmuxCheatSheetModal.tsx`, `keymap.ts` (planned) |
| Hint navigation overlay | Keyboard-only jump-to-target (Vimium-style) | per-target letter badge over any `[data-hint-id]` (task card, project row, sidebar task), type-to-jump | mutation/destructive target, visible chrome, durable config | `HintOverlay.tsx`, `utils/hintLabels.ts` |
| Toast | Transient feedback for **every** origin (in-app action, agent/CLI push, background watcher) — one anatomy: optional source line → message → optional click target → swipe/X dismiss | status, error, success, warning, click-through to the surface the toast is about | persistent/primary action, multi-step flow, a fabricated source line | `toast.tsx` (see §5.7) |
| Diagnostics (crash + error surface) | Make renderer faults visible in remote/mobile where there is no devtools | crash fallback (error boundary), bootstrap phase + timeout→retry, captured error list, copy/clear, conditional floating entry | navigation destination, mutation of app data, permanent chrome in the happy path | `RootErrorBoundary.tsx`, `BootstrapScreen.tsx`, `DiagnosticsPanel.tsx`, `DiagnosticsIndicator.tsx`, `diagnostics.ts` (see §5.5) |
| Inline help (Tooltip / HelpSpot → HelpCard / help mode) | Explain what a section is, why it exists, what to do in it | fast control tooltip, section (i) in header-bearing surfaces, rich read-only HelpCard, screen-wide help-mode overlay | mutation, multi-step tour, permanent (i) in quickbars/cards/toolbars | `Tooltip.tsx`, `HelpSpot.tsx`, `HelpCard.tsx`, `HelpOverlay.tsx`, `help.ts` (see §5.4) |
| Productivity Stats (Velocity Cockpit) | Read-only showcase of shipping output over time | hero speedometer gauges, SVG bar/area charts, per-project gauge wall, counters, time-range switch + prev/next period navigation, per-project→board jump | mutation, lifecycle/config action, header button, data filter (new dimension beyond time) | `ProductivityStatsView.tsx`, `components/stats/*` |

**Board lifecycle presentation (`Observed`, 2026-08-19):** `user-questions` remains a persisted lifecycle status and hook target, but boards project it into **Agent is Working** with a full-card amber wash and a text `Needs input` badge. AI Review mounts only while occupied; PR Review remains visible for peer-reviewed git projects because it is a durable external waiting stage. Completed stays visible, while the workspace board omits Cancelled from its daily-work matrix; project boards retain Cancelled as reachable history. Desktop single-project columns share the available width as a compact grid instead of defaulting to horizontal scroll. The workspace board uses one canonical header plus project swimlanes, forbids cross-project drag, rolls project-specific custom columns into a non-drop `Custom` column, and gives each project's To Do cell a project-scoped `New Task` action.

Note: native menu is the **overflow/expert** surface; frequent actions are mirrored into DOM toolbars (inspector, board).

The **command palette** is keyboard-only by design (no toolbar/breadcrumb button → sidesteps button-creep) and runs in two sibling modes on one shared `PaletteShell`. **Navigation (Cmd+K):** fuzzy-jumps to a **project**; the matcher (`utils/fuzzyMatch.ts`) is the single matcher for short UI entities. **Actions (Cmd+Shift+P):** fuzzy-runs a command via `handleMenuAction` (DOM mirror of the native menu), listing only context-applicable commands and excluding destructive + modal/inline flows by policy. It is **not** the task switcher: the switcher (Option+Tab) hold-cycles the *active tasks*; the palette type-searches. Hotkeys avoid `Cmd+T` (universal new-tab; the live terminal underneath intercepts it). The navigation-vs-action question is resolved as **two-surfaces-one-shell** — see `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-18) and decision record 072. **Future:** Cmd+K absorbs task search too.

### 5.1 Task info panel — bar model (2×2) — `Observed`

The inspector header (`TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, both collapsed and expanded states) is a **2×2 grid of quickbars**: two rows, each split into a left and a right bar by a `flex-1` spacer. This exploits the wide desktop width instead of stacking more rows above the terminal (the panel has a hard height budget, `MAX_RATIO = 0.33`). **Each bar owns exactly one action domain. Panel chrome is not a bar.**

| Bar | Position | Domain | Contents | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Context | row 1, left | task identity & lifecycle | variant switcher (conditional, leading), watch toggle, status dropdown, diff-summary badge, include-tests toggle, label strip | `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` (row 1 left cluster) |
| Session/Agent | row 1, right | drive the session & agents | spawn extra agent, bug hunters, tmux controls, send message later (scheduled agent message) | `TaskInfoPanel.tsx` (row 1 right cluster), `TaskTmuxControls.tsx` |
| Git | row 2, left | branch & PR | branch name/status, show diff, refresh, copy worktree path, open PR | `task-info-panel/TaskGitActions.tsx` |
| Runtime & access | row 2, right | project runtime outputs + access to them | open-in, scripts, dev server, ports, separate conditional Images and Artifacts controls (count>0 only); ports/resources also render as detail in the expanded body | `task-info-panel/TaskOpenIn.tsx`, `TaskSharedImages.tsx`, `TaskArtifacts.tsx` |

Rules:

- **Row 1 = "Drive"** (what the task is + how I control its session). **Row 2 = "Outputs"** (what the work produces and how I access it: branch/PR + open-in/scripts/running server). open-in lives here because it opens the produced worktree, and it keeps the Runtime bar balanced (3 controls) instead of leaving it sparse.
- **Chrome** (collapse/expand, fullscreen toggle, ⚙ worktree-settings) is pinned to the far right edge of row 1 and is **not** counted as a bar or against any bar's budget.
- A new control must be assigned to exactly one domain and placed in that bar. Do not drop it into whichever bar has room — that is how the pre-2026-06 "everything in row-1-right" dumpster happened.
- **Label overflow:** the Context bar shows up to `MAX_INLINE_LABELS` (4) chips inline, then a `+k` chip (hover lists the rest). The full label list still renders in the expanded metadata grid, so the inline strip may truncate safely.
- **Variant switcher (conditional):** when the task's variant group has ≥ 2 **alive** (active-status) variants, the Context bar leads with a compact segmented switcher — one numbered chip per alive variant (status-colored, current highlighted); click switches the workspace to that sibling. It counts as **one composite control** (like the label strip) and is an explicit conditional exception to the four-control budget; no unrelated control inherits the exception. Keyboard: `⇧⌘[` / `⇧⌘]` cycles alive variants (registered in `keymap.ts`).
- **Tight bars fold, they never overflow:** each bar is boxed (`min-w-0 overflow-hidden`) so its contents cannot paint over the neighbouring bar or the pinned chrome, and the fold order is driven by the **panel's own width** (`useContainerWidth`, not `useCompact`): `< 1280px` folds the label strip to its `+k` chip, clamps the branch name and drops the text labels of the tmux-layout and Runtime controls; `< 900px` also drops the label strip and the include-tests toggle. Long sentence labels are banned from a bar — the chip carries the short label, the sentence lives in the tooltip (see decision 164).
- Per-bar visible-action budget stays at the toolbar default (≤ 4 visible, then overflow). **Explicit exception:** the Runtime bar may additionally show separate `Images` and `Artifacts` controls when those outputs exist; both are conditional, user-selected identities rather than permanent chrome. Do not use this exception for unrelated controls.

### 5.2 Keyboard-shortcut registry, editor + reference overlay — `Observed`

Keyboard shortcuts are the app's primary interaction model, so they get a **single source of truth**:
`src/mainview/keymap.ts` declares every **app-level** shortcut as data (`id`, machine-readable
`defaults` bindings, `descKey`, `category`, `remappable`). The registry **drives dispatch**: handlers
ask `matchesShortcut(e, id)` instead of hand-writing modifier conditions, so a user rebind takes
effect everywhere at once. Display strings are *derived* from the bindings, never authored twice.

**Three consumers, one registry — each with its own job:**

| Surface | Job | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `keymap.ts` + `resolveKeymap()` | data + dispatch | the only place a combo is defined; overrides layer on top of `defaults` |
| `KeyboardShortcutsModal` (⌘/) | ephemeral **reference** | read-only; shows the *resolved* combo, never the default; no edit affordance |
| Settings → **Keyboard** category | durable **configuration** | the only place a binding is changed |

Reference and editor are **not duplicates** — they are different action classes (`onboarding/help`
vs `configuration`), and the manifest forbids durable configuration inside the reference overlay. The
overlay may carry exactly **one** `link` to the editor ("Customize…"), never inline editing.

The overlay is reached only via **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts**, the **⌘/ (Ctrl+/)** chord, and the
**⇧⌘P** palette — never a toolbar/header button (toolbar-button-creep) and never a navigation
destination (ephemeral reference ≠ a place). The same `keymap.ts` data renders the README table and
the website (`docs/index.html`). Adding a new app-level shortcut **must** add a `keymap.ts` entry.

**Not every shortcut is remappable, and the UI must say so rather than hide it.** Structural
bindings — the `g`-prefix chord sequences, the `⌘1–9` / `⇧⌘1–9` digit families, the hold-modifier
task switcher, and `Esc` — stay fixed and render as read-only rows with a one-line reason. Hiding
them would make the editor read as an incomplete keymap; greying them out with a *why* is the honest
form.

See `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-19, 2026-08-02).

### 5.3 Diff review viewer — `Observed`

Full-screen surface (`TaskDiffViewer.tsx`) reached from the inspector `show_diff` action / `diff_summary_badge`. It is a **read + review** surface: it renders a task's diff and lets the user attach inline comments, then export them as an XML review prompt for the agent. It performs **no git mutation and no task-lifecycle action** — those stay in the inspector and native menu.

Layout = left **Files aside** (collapsible, `22rem`) + right **diff stream**.

- **Top toolbar (right of file tree):** diff-mode segmented control (`uncommitted | branch | unpushed | recent`, mode persisted), view-mode toggle (`split | unified`), include-tests toggle, search (`Cmd+F`, in-diff find with next/prev + highlight), close/back (`Esc`). The `recent` ("Recent commits") segment is a **split-button**: the body activates `HEAD~N..HEAD` (committed-only, clamped to the branch's own commits) at the current N; a `▾` caret opens a preset popover (1/2/3/5/10). N is **not** persisted — it resets to 1 on every diff open — while the mode selection follows the same localStorage preference as the other three. Body label reflects the selected N; the header sub-label reflects the *effective* (clamped) count honestly.
- **Files aside** contains two cards: the **Review export card** (top) and the **Files card** (read-progress + expand/collapse-all + the file tree).
- **Per-file header (diff stream):** status chip (A/M/D/R/C/T/?), path (click = expand/collapse), **copy-file-path** icon button (role `neutral`/icon), `+N/−N` stat pill, **mark-read** checkbox (success-tinted when read), expand/collapse caret. The path renders as **one truncating line at every width** (directory truncates, basename always survives) and the identity column carries a `basis-[15rem]` floor, so the trailing controls wrap onto a second row instead of squeezing the path into a one-character-per-line column.
- **Inline comments:** drag across the gutter to select a line range (or use the hover `+` widget for a single line) → composer opens → comment is added to a per-file/per-side/per-line thread. Threads render inline and are editable/deletable in place.
- **Composer actions (budget: 3):** `Cancel` (`neutral`), **`Send now`** (`secondary`), `Add comment` (`primary`). `Send now` is the one-shot lane: the comment is parked in the review and shipped to the agent in one click instead of add → send. **No send ever deletes a comment** — a resolved send only proves the keys left dev3, so the text is marked `Sent` and kept; clearing stays the explicit, confirmed `Reset review` (decision `never-destroy-a-review-on-send`).
- **Per-comment actions (budget: 3, no growth):** `Edit` (`neutral`), `Delete` (`destructive`), `Send to agent` (`secondary`) — the same pattern as the GitHub thread action, pushing that single comment into the task terminal. Sending is per comment and **sticky**: the comment is marked `Sent`, persisted with the review, and leaves the export payload, so `Copy review` and the batch `Send to Agent` cover **only unsent** comments. Sent comments stay visible and re-readable in the export card (greyed, `Sent` badge); editing one clears the mark so the edited text can be delivered again. The **batch** send marks its comments the same way rather than wiping the review — the pre-2026-08-10 auto-clear destroyed reviews whose delivery was never actually proven.

**Review export card — action hierarchy (the one budgeted cluster):**

The whole cluster lives on the card's **title line** — count and all three actions in one `h-7` row — and the card collapses to that single line plus one hint sentence when the review is empty. Rare actions do not get full-width buttons here; an empty review renders no buttons at all.

| Control | Role | Token | Visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Copy | `primary` (the single primary here) | `bg-accent-fill` solid, success-tint on copied | only when ≥ 1 comment |
| Send | `secondary` | `bg-base` + `border-edge`, success-tint on sent | only when ≥ 1 comment |
| Reset review | `destructive`, low-emphasis, **icon-only** (`aria-label` + tooltip) | ghost-danger: `text-danger` + `border-danger/30` + `hover:bg-danger/10` | only when ≥ 1 comment; confirmation required |
| Comment count | `status` | plain mono text, **never a bordered box** (a boxed number reads as an editable input) | only when ≥ 1 comment |
| Comment item | `link`-like (scroll-to) | `bg-raised/65`, accent on hover; titled `Comment N/total` | per comment |

**GitHub PR review layer (read-only) — `Observed` (2026-07-19):** when the task has an associated PR, the viewer renders GitHub review threads inline on their anchored lines (same widget/extend mechanism as local comments, visually distinct: GitHub glyph, author login, timestamp, markdown body) plus a collapsible **"Conversation (N)"** strip at the top of the diff stream listing top-level PR comments. That strip is the layer's one control cluster (collapse, show-resolved toggle, refresh, fetched-at, PR link) — never toolbar buttons. Unresolved threads expand by default; resolved hide behind the toggle; threads that no longer map onto the rendered diff collapse into a per-file "Outdated" group (threads on files absent from the diff group inside the conversation block) — nothing is silently dropped. Inline anchoring is **branch-mode only**; other modes show a slim "N review threads → Branch diff" hint. Per-thread actions: `Send to agent` (role `secondary` — pushes a fix prompt into the task terminal; the surface primary stays Copy review), `Open on GitHub` (role `link`), `Include in export` (opt-in into the XML export; exported entries carry an origin marker). **Hard rule: no writes to GitHub from this surface — no reply, no resolve, no authoring; links out instead.** Data comes from one cached on-demand RPC (gh GraphQL) fetched on diff open / manual refresh; badge counts stay on the background PR poller.

Rules specific to this surface:
- **One primary only** — `Copy review` owns it. `Reset review` is destructive and must never carry primary/accent fill (would compete and risk an accidental data-loss click). It sits below Copy, lower-emphasis, gated behind a `confirm()` dialog.
- **The inline review is a short-lived safety net, not clipboard-only or permanent.** Comments persist per task (`localStorage`) and survive unmount / diff reload / app restart, but only for a **3-day TTL** measured from when the review was first created — after that they auto-expire on next read. The clipboard is a *transport*, not the store: if a stray terminal selection clobbers the copied review, reopen the diff and copy again. The review is cleared by the **Reset review** button or by TTL expiry. A **global sweep** on every diff-viewer mount prunes expired/corrupt review keys across all tasks, so entries for never-reopened or deleted tasks cannot accumulate in `localStorage`. Leaving the surface does **not** discard it — so no "discard review?" guard on close.
- No new top-level destination, no toolbar-creep into the inspector: the whole review lifecycle lives inside this surface.

### 5.4 Inline help system — Tooltip / HelpSpot / help mode — `Observed`

**Problem.** The app explains itself through ~227 native `title=` attributes: slow (OS hover delay), unstyled, control-scoped — they can name a button but never explain a *section* ("what is this toolbar, why does it exist, what do I do here"). No shared Tooltip primitive exists; each custom popover re-implements positioning.

**Doctrine — help coverage is owed, not earned.** dev-3.0 ships no tutorials, no onboarding tour, and no manual users actually read: the UI is the product's **only** channel for conveying what the author meant by a surface, a field, or a smart default. Feature *tips* are earned (see the tips policy); **help is owed** — shipping a user-facing surface or a non-self-evident control without registered help means shipping it unexplained. The counterweight is unchanged: coverage lives in the registry + help mode (zero permanent chrome), while permanent (i) icons stay strictly budgeted.

**One registry, three layers:**

1. **`Tooltip`** — a fast styled popover primitive (portal, shared positioning util, ~250 ms hover-intent, instant re-show grace) that progressively replaces native `title=` on icon-only controls. Control-level: *what does this button do*. Migration is incremental — densest surfaces first (inspector bars, GlobalHeader, TaskCard).
2. **`HelpSpot` → `HelpCard`** — a small ghost **(i)** icon allowed **only** in surfaces that already have a header/title row (SettingsSection headings, modal headers, Kanban column headers, diff-viewer toolbar, stats section titles), plus — earned, never wholesale — a form-field label whose field has *surprising* behavior (e.g. the contextual branch prefill); a row of (i) on every field is banned. Hover (intent) or click (pins) opens a **HelpCard**: topic title, 2–4 sentence body, optional "what you can do here" bullets, optional shortcut chips (crosslinked to `keymap.ts` ids), optional nav link (e.g. "Open Keyboard Shortcuts"). Budget: **≤ 1 HelpSpot per section header**; icon role `ghost`, hover emphasis reuses `accent` (no new `--info` token). Every registry-backed HelpSpot renders its own `data-help-id`, so it is **automatically a help-mode zone**.
3. **Help mode — the master surface.** A screen-wide "Explain this screen" overlay. Entry points: the header **(?)** button, Help menu, `⇧⌘/`, `⇧⌘P` palette entry, header kebab (narrow/touch — the native menu is absent in remote). Every registered zone (tagged `data-help-id`, mirroring the hint overlay's `data-hint-id`) gets an (i) badge + outline; hover/click any zone opens the same HelpCard; `Esc` exits. It explains the **current screen state**: the zone scan reads the live DOM and skips covered elements, so with a modal open it lights the modal's own zones (per-field included) instead of the board behind it. This is how dense headerless zones and form fields get help **with zero permanent chrome**.

**Registry:** `src/mainview/help.ts` (`HELP_TOPICS`: id, titleKey, bodyKey, optional bullets/shortcutIds/link) — the same declare-as-data pattern as `keymap.ts` and `tips.ts`; content localized in an `help.ts` i18n domain (en/ru/es). Help copy is never hardcoded in components. Topics may crosslink tips (`tip.*`) instead of duplicating text. Form-field topics use the `field.*` namespace.

**Coverage law (hard rule):**
- Every §5 surface/section, and every form field or control whose behavior is not fully evident from its label (smart default, contextual prefill, hidden fallback, side effect), MUST have a registry topic reachable in help mode. Inside a modal, help mode lights each registered field individually — that, not a permanent (i) per field, is how per-field intent reaches the user.
- New user-facing UI ships its topic + zone **in the same commit** — the same lockstep discipline `keymap.ts` imposes on shortcuts.
- **Coverage floor (positive manifest).** The dangling/orphan checks only police ids that are *already* referenced — a surface with **no** help id at all is invisible to them, so pre-doctrine surfaces silently read as "covered". `help.ts` exports `REQUIRED_HELP_SURFACES`, the curated list of canonical §5 surfaces/sections; `help.test.ts` asserts every entry resolves to a topic **and** mounts a reachable zone. Adding a §5 surface means adding it to that list in the same commit — you cannot then ship it uncovered. The list is surfaces/sections only (not every sub-zone); dynamic `board.column.*` ids stay guarded by the per-status test; transient nav/help overlays, confirm/error/search modals, native menus, the chrome-free immersive terminal, and the earned/remote-only Diagnostics surface (§5.5) are deliberately excluded (documented in the manifest, not oversight).

**Correlation invariant (hard rule):**
- Help mode shows a **superset** of all inline help. A HelpSpot only renders registry topics (automatic via layer 2; the one exception is ad-hoc `content` for user-authored objects, e.g. custom-column descriptions). Prefer *also* tagging the section container with the same id — the help-mode scan keeps the first visible DOM match, so a container outline naturally wins over the tiny icon.
- A `data-help-id` (or HelpSpot `topicId`) with no registry topic is a **silent no-op** — HelpSpot renders nothing and help mode skips the zone; the 2026-07 settings re-org silently lost help for three settings categories exactly this way. `__tests__/help.test.ts` guards both directions: every referenced id resolves to a topic, every topic is mounted somewhere.

**Hard rules (chrome):**
- A permanent (i) never sits inside quickbars, task cards, or action toolbars — those zones are covered by help mode only (creep protection; see §11).
- HelpCard is **read-only**: navigation links allowed, mutations forbidden; no multi-step tours in v1.
- HelpCard clamps to the viewport (`max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`), honours `prefers-reduced-motion`, is keyboard-reachable (HelpSpot is a focusable button, `Enter` pins, `Esc` closes) and announced via `aria-describedby`/`role="dialog"` when pinned.

### 5.5 Diagnostics — crash & error surface (remote/mobile) — `Observed`

**Problem.** In browser remote mode — especially on a phone with no devtools — a renderer fault is invisible: a React crash unmounts the tree to a blank page, a stuck bootstrap spins a bare "Loading…" (up to the 120s RPC timeout), and `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection`/WebSocket failures go only to console/GA4/a backend file the user can't see. The user can neither see nor report what broke.

**One store, three surfaces (+ a pre-React loader):**

1. **`diagnostics.ts`** — a framework-agnostic ring buffer (cap 50, deduped) fed by `window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`, the React boundary, and RPC/WS transport failures/connection-state changes. No React import, so the crash fallback can read it even when the provider tree is unmounted.
2. **`RootErrorBoundary`** — wraps the providers **and** `App` in `main.tsx` (so a provider crash is still caught). Self-contained English fallback (a **documented i18n exception** — the translation provider may be what threw) with the message, recent diagnostics, and Reload / Copy details.
3. **`BootstrapScreen`** — replaces the two bare loading spinners: names the phase (connecting / authenticating / loading) and, after a ~12s stuck timeout, flips to an actionable panel (likely cause + last captured error + Retry/Reload).
4. **`DiagnosticsPanel` + `DiagnosticsIndicator`** — the full viewer (copy/clear, viewport-clamped for phones) opened from a **conditional** floating pill that renders **only in remote mode and only when `errorCount > 0`** — zero chrome on the happy path (no button-creep), absent in the Electrobun desktop shell (which has devtools + "Open logs"). Plus a static pre-React loader in `index.html` (inside `#root`, replaced on mount) so a failed bundle shows a hint + Reload instead of a blank flash.
5. **`ConnectionStatusPill`, docked with the above in `StatusDock`** — the post-boot half of `BootstrapScreen`. Once the app has rendered, a dropped remote socket used to be invisible (stale board, actions silently queued until the 120s RPC timeout — the app read as frozen). The pill names the unhealthy transport state (warning tokens, pulsing dot), is itself the retry (`reconnectRpc()`), and confirms recovery with a ~2.5s "Back online" (success tokens) so the user gets closure. `auth-failed` is excluded — the scan-QR screen owns it. `StatusDock` owns the bottom-left corner and safe-area insets so the two conditional pills stack instead of overlapping, and it sits **outside** the terminal-immersive gate: transport health is not immersive chrome.

**Hard rules:** the crash fallback and pre-React loader use inline/neutral styling and no providers (they must survive a broken theme/i18n). The diagnostics entry point is earned, not permanent — never a toolbar/header button, never a nav destination. All surfaces are pure React (no native dialog). See `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-07-10, 2026-07-25).

**Owed by every transport-fed screen (data-fetch states):** a fetch over the remote transport may hang or die, so the screen must show a **delayed skeleton** (~200 ms, so local fetches don't flash) instead of its empty state, an **error panel** that names the transport cause and offers Retry, and a **self-heal refetch** when `rpcState` returns to `connected`. **Cached data always wins** — a background refetch or a reconnect must never blank a board the user is already reading. Reference implementation: `ProjectView` + `KanbanBoardSkeleton` / `BoardLoadFailed`; an empty board where a load failed is a bug, not an empty state.

### 5.6 Identity markers — task identity glyphs — `Observed`

One shared, non-interactive glyph (`NativeBackendMark`) — a bolt in a rounded frame — marks the **three task-identity surfaces**: before the title on the Kanban card, between the `#seq` badge and the title in the Task View breadcrumb, and at the head of the Active Tasks row's **identity line, before the agent badge** (it qualifies the task, not the agent that runs it). It states the task's **persisted terminal-backend identity** and nothing else — never that a terminal is running, connected, healthy, focused, or owns a writer lease.

- **Renders only for an explicit `native` record.** Explicit `tmux` and legacy records with no field render nothing, so the dense surfaces stay quiet; an unknown value never guesses. Identity comes only from the shared `terminal-backend-identity` codec — never a raw field check, platform sniff, or session-liveness inference.
- **Consumes no action slot and no budget:** not focusable, no shortcut, no setting, no menu item, no tip. Accent-toned, no new design token.
- **Never colour-only:** localized tooltip + accessible name in en/ru/es. On the sidebar the row is a `role="button"` with its own `aria-label`, which overrides descendants — so the backend label is appended to **that** name, not left on the inner span.


**Second member — foreign code (`ForeignCodeMark`, 2026-08-10).** An eye glyph marks a task about commits the user did not write (`Task.foreignCode`): on the Kanban card next to the backend mark, and in the inspector metadata beside the branch it qualifies. Same contract as above — non-interactive, no action slot, no budget, accent-toned, localized name + tooltip.

- **Accent, never warning, on an identity surface.** The glyph answers *whose code*, which is not a fault; most review tasks are ordinary work. The loud signal belongs where the user must act: the `warning`-toned RUNS badge on a changed executable-config file in the diff viewer (`.dev3/config.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json` — `shared/executable-config-files.ts`). Amber on the board would spend the warning token on the happy path, and `danger` is already "deleted" one badge to its left in that same diff row.
- **A marker states a property; it never enforces one.** `foreignCode` blocks no transition and makes nothing read-only. The one consequence — this branch's `.dev3` commands and agent trust are not used — is stated in the tooltip and in the inspector row, which also carries the single control that hands trust back (confirm-gated, `TaskInfoPanel`).
- **The board carries the glyph only because the property belongs to the task.** A branch-level marker was rejected for the card: the card never shows a branch name, so a glyph about the branch has no object there to qualify (board noise is the project's top anti-pattern, §11).

Evidence: `NativeBackendMark.tsx`, `ForeignCodeMark.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`, `TaskInfoPanel.tsx`, `TaskDiffViewer.tsx`, `ActiveTasksSidebar.tsx`, `GlobalHeader.tsx`.

### 5.7 Toast anatomy — one shape for every origin — `Observed`

The user runs many tasks in parallel, so a toast must answer **"which of my tasks is this about, and how do I get there"** before it says anything else. Origin (in-app click, `dev3 notify` push, background watcher) must not change the shape.

| Slot | Rule |
|---|---|
| Source line | **Where it came from**, one line, `truncate`, `text-micro font-mono text-fg-muted`. Task → `#seq · project · task title`; no task but a project → the project name; neither → the app area (`Settings`, `Update`, `Dashboard`, `Terminal`, `Menu`). `#seq` leads so ellipsis eats the title, not the identifier. |
| Message | The sentence. `break-words`, no truncation. |
| Click target | The **most specific surface the toast is about** — image viewer, diff, settings section. The owning task is the *fallback*, never an override. |
| Dismiss | Swipe right (pointer + touch) **and** the X button **and** auto-timeout. Swipe is never the only way (§12 gesture law). |

Rules:

- **Never fabricate a source line, but never leave one blank that could be filled.** The line answers "where did this come from", and every toast has an answer that is not the app's own name. Falling back to `dev-3.0` on a Settings toast is fabrication by another route: it adds a line that carries nothing.
- **The fallback order is task → project → app area, first match wins.** An app area is a label, not a destination: it gets no click target, because there is nothing specific to open.
- **Origin is resolved centrally, not composed per call site.** A caller passes one token — `taskId`, `projectId`, or `source` — and `ToastHost` composes the line and the default click target through a resolver injected by `App.tsx` (areas need no state and are localized in the host). The toast module stays free of app-state imports; ~180 call sites stay one field long; a future toast is correct by default. Explicitly passed `context`/`onClick` always win.
- **`contextDetail`** appends one more segment after the resolved origin (`dev-3.0 · Nightly digest`) when the toast is about a named thing inside that scope.
- **The clickable overlay's accessible name is `context — message`**, not the message alone: a screen reader must hear which task it is being sent to.

- **One documented exception to "one origin": agent-to-agent traffic.** A `dev3 message` between two agents has a sender AND a receiver, so its source line is the pair — `#7 Coordinator → #42 Receiver` — and the click goes to the **receiver**, whose terminal now holds the text. It also carries the only non-severity variant, `agent` (violet `--agent`): identity, not severity, so it can never be misread as a status, a warning, or a failure. Silent for anything the human sent and for a send that landed nowhere.

Evidence: `toast.tsx`, `App.tsx` (`ToastHost` mount, `openTaskFromNotification`).

### 5.8 Agent-written log — clamped preview + own overlay — `Observed`

Task notes look like a few sticky notes and behave like a log: **2 999 of the 3 030 notes on disk were written by `dev3 note add`, not by a human** (31 user notes). The average agent note is 929 characters, the worst task carries 143 of them (313 321 characters), and rendering that inline turned the mobile actions sheet into 45 900 px of scroll. Any object-scoped content an agent appends to without a ceiling inherits this shape.

The rule, three parts:

- **The body clamps.** An agent-written body folds at 6 lines (`NoteItem`, `clamp` prop) with a `Show more` / `Show less` toggle. The toggle appears **only when the body actually overflows** — measured while folded, since an unfolded body never overflows itself. A `Show more` on a two-line note is noise. Editable (user) bodies are never clamped: they already sit in a fixed-height `textarea`, and folding a field you are typing into is a bug.
- **The list caps.** The object's own surface shows the **newest 3** entries — the p90 task has 5 notes and the median exactly 1, so the common case still reads with zero taps — plus a count beside the section title and one `Show all N` row. Below the cap nothing changes; the row does not exist.
- **The tail gets a surface.** `Show all N` opens `TaskNotesOverlay`: `BottomSheet` on narrow (the actions sheet closes first — a log replaces a sheet, it never stacks on one), a centered dialog on wide. It renders the whole log, still clamped per entry, so 143 entries stay a bounded DOM and no virtualization is owed.

The archived-task path (`TaskDetailModal`) is already a dedicated surface, so it takes the clamp and skips the cap.

## 6. Action taxonomy — `Observed`

| Action type | Definition | Placement | Token role |
|---|---|---|---|
| primary_action | Main safe action for screen/flow (Create Task, Add Project, Save) | modal footer / page header | primary (`bg-accent-fill`), max 1 visible |
| object_action | Acts on one task/project (rename, overview, watch, duplicate, open-in) | inspector, card context menu, menu `Task` | secondary / ghost |
| git_action | pull, push, create PR, merge, rebase, branch status | inspector `TaskGitActions`, menu `Project`, board git-pull | secondary; runs in visible terminal (decision 008) |
| dev_server_action | start / stop / restart / status | inspector `TaskDevServer`, menu `Project.DevServer` | neutral; risky variants flagged |
| lifecycle_action | move task status, complete, cancel (mostly hook-driven) | board drag, status dropdown, menu `Task.MoveToStatus` | status-colored |
| configuration | durable behavior change (scripts, columns, labels, theme, locale, gh account) | settings, project settings | secondary |
| destructive | delete task, remove project, cancel, reset terminal, hard refresh | overflow, context menu, confirm dialog, danger zone | destructive (`text-danger`/`bg-danger`), confirmation required |
| expert_shortcut | rare known action (debug screens, tmux cheat sheet, zoom, gauge/viewport lab) | menu `View`/`Debug`, keyboard | neutral |
| onboarding_help | explains a surface/section (help topics, tips, shortcuts reference) | HelpSpot in section headers, help-mode overlay, menu `Help`, TipCard | ghost icon; accent reused for informational emphasis |
| agent_request | an agent asks the user to let it act (complete a task, launch another task) | blocking dialog, never a toast — `confirm()` for yes/no, own modal when the answer needs input | **identity is fixed, severity is not**: always accent border + AI-agent-request badge + autofocused decline; the accepting button is `destructive` only when the action destroys state (completion), `primary` when it creates state (launch) |

**Why identity and severity are separate axes (§6, `agent_request`):** the badge answers *who asked*, the button color answers *what it costs*. Painting a constructive agent request red to signal "an AI wants this" spends the danger token on a reversible action and trains the user to click through red — so the AI-origin signal lives entirely in the border, badge, and focus placement, and never in the accept button's role.

## 7. Design token & variant policy — `Observed`

Tokens are CSS custom properties in `src/mainview/index.css`, mapped to Tailwind in `tailwind.config.js`, with `dark` (default) and `light` themes. **Never hardcode hex/rgb in components** (AGENTS.md). There is **no `variant=` prop** — document semantic role → token class.

### Button roles

| Semantic role | Token class | Use for | Do not use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| primary | `bg-accent-fill` / `hover:bg-accent-fill-hover` (white text) | the one main safe action | competing CTAs, destructive actions |
| secondary | `bg-raised`/`bg-elevated` + `border-edge`, or `text-accent bg-accent/10` | supporting visible action | the irreversible main action |
| ghost | transparent + `hover:bg-raised-hover`/`hover:bg-elevated-hover` | dense-toolbar icon/utility buttons | critical-path primary |
| destructive | `text-danger`, `hover:bg-danger/10..15`, `border-danger/30` (or solid `bg-danger`) | delete, remove, cancel, reset | safe routine actions |
| link | `text-accent hover:text-accent-hover` | inline navigation / open-in | form submit primary |

Evidence: `TaskDetailModal.tsx` (primary `bg-accent`, destructive `hover:bg-danger/10`), `TaskInfoPanel.tsx:585` (destructive delete).

### One dropdown primitive — `Select`

`src/mainview/components/Select.tsx` is the app's only dropdown. It is portalled, viewport-flipped, keyboard-driven, and registered in the overlay-layer stack. Two opt-in capabilities extend it instead of forking it: `searchable` adds a filter input inside the panel (focus moves into the panel, `aria-activedescendant` rides the input), and `allowCustom` lets the typed text be committed as the value, rendering a "use this" row and marking an off-list current value as custom. Reach for `allowCustom` wherever the app's own enum list may lag reality — model ids, permission modes, effort levels, budgets. Do not add a second combobox component; `LabelPicker`'s create-a-label flow stays label-specific.

### State colors

| Role | Token | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| success | `--success` / `--success-hover` (green) | completed, healthy, running dev server |
| warning | `--warning` (yellow) | needs attention, degraded, your-review |
| danger | `--danger` (red) | failed, destructive risk, cancelled |
| awake | `--awake` / `--awake-hover` (amber, both themes) | sleep-prevention active (the header coffee toggle); a distinct "always-on" affordance, not a warning |
| info | **none** (`Proposed`) | no dedicated token; accent/blue reused |

### Status colors — documented exception

`STATUS_COLORS` / `STATUS_COLORS_LIGHT` (`types.ts`) are inline hex for column headers, card borders, and dots. This is the one allowed hardcoded-color case.

## 8. Screen patterns — `Observed`

- **List screen** (dashboard, board): header with create entry; label filter (board) / search (sidebar); per-item context menu; open navigates; compact empty states (decision 047).
- **Detail screen** (task): two-row task header; `TaskInfoPanel` inspector; task-scoped object/git/dev-server actions; full-screen or split terminal.
- **Settings screen** (Global / Project): Global Settings uses a left-nav master-detail layout with eight Settings categories, localized entry search, and immediate RPC/local persistence; Project Settings keeps its existing tabs; destructive removal stays behind confirmation.
- **Library inside a Settings category** — sanctioned only where one category owns dozens of same-shaped records. The Settings entry renders a **filterable list + exactly one detail editor**; the record's own actions live in the editor, never repeated on list rows; it stays inside the category's detail pane and is never a second left-nav. First and reference instance: **Settings → Agents**, whose ~100 launch presets are unusable as a flat list. Its list groups presets by the same Model → Mode labels the launch picker derives (`groupLabel`/`modeLabel`), so Settings and launch speak one language. Narrow (<768): list first, picking a record swaps the pane to the editor with a visible back affordance — §12.3's "one thing at a time", one level deeper. Enum fields in such an editor use the searchable creatable `Select` (§7) so a value the app has never heard of stays typeable.

Global Settings vocabulary is deliberate: a left-nav item is a **Settings category**, and each searchable/anchored setting is a **Settings entry** registered in `src/mainview/settings-registry.ts`. The registry documents metadata and integrity, while existing bespoke controls own rendering and CRUD behavior. Legacy deep-link ids remain accepted and map through `LEGACY_SETTINGS_CATEGORY_MAP`; Project Settings' internal `global` tab remains labeled “Board” in its UI (known collision, out of scope).

## 9. Complexity budgets

| Surface | Budget | Overflow rule |
|---|---:|---|
| Global nav destinations | 7 | group / demote to menu |
| Page header primary | 1 | demote to secondary |
| Page header secondary | 2 | overflow |
| Task card inline actions | 2 | push to context menu |
| Toolbar visible actions | 4 | overflow after 4 |
| Tabs | 6 | more-menu / subpage |
| Task info panel | 4 bars (2×2), ≤ 4 visible per bar | assign new control to one domain bar; overflow after 4 ⇒ promote that domain to its own row (see §5.1) |

| Active Tasks sidebar row | 2 inline controls (lifecycle rail + priority badge) | demote to the row context menu; the row is a navigator, not a board |
| Settings library toolbar (§8) | 4 visible controls; 5 always-visible editor fields | extra editor fields go behind the single `Advanced` disclosure; list rows stay actionless |

**Split lifecycle controls count as one.** The status control may carry a second half that commits the pipeline's own terminal move (the ✓ → Completed) without spending a second card slot, provided it is glued to the status trigger, shares its hover surface, is desktop-only (narrow keeps the BottomSheet's promoted Completed row at ≥ 44px), and disappears when `getAllowedTransitions` forbids the target. Any action that is not the control's own lifecycle move costs its own slot — this is not a general licence for a second button.

## 9a. Quality floors — what every surface must clear

A gate, not a goal. Every surface passes these before shipping; a floor is not earned by meeting it once — a regression resets the clock. All six subsections are `Proposed` unless noted.

### 9a.1 Accessibility — `Proposed`

**Focus ring.** Every interactive element shows the global `:focus-visible` ring from `index.css`. Two specificity traps:
- **`focus:outline-none` is banned** — Tailwind compiles it to `.focus\:outline-none:focus` at specificity (0,2,0), beating the global `:focus-visible` rule at (0,1,0) regardless of source order and killing the keyboard ring.
- Bare `outline-none` (0,1,0) is fine — it loses to the global rule by source order because the ring is authored after `@tailwind utilities`.

| Constraint | Floor |
|---|---|
| Hit area | 24×24 CSS px (WCAG 2.5.8); 44×44 px on touch via `.touch-actions` in `index.css` — the sheet default, not opt-in |
| Keyboard path | Every pointer interaction has a keyboard equivalent; Escape closes overlays; Arrow keys move inside composite widgets |
| Icon controls | Every icon-only control has an accessible name; a tooltip is **not** an accessible name |
| `role="tab"` | Is a promise of roving tabindex — if you will not implement it, ship plain buttons with `aria-pressed` |
| `aria-modal` surface | Accessible name (`aria-labelledby` at its title), focus trap, focus restore; `useFocusTrap` is the one implementation |
| Landmarks | One `sr-only` `<h1>` per route; `document.title` follows the route (the tab title is the only orientation cue in remote mode) |
| Zoom | Must render and reflow at 200% browser zoom and at a 320px viewport. **Pinch-zoom is capped on purpose** on browser remote (`user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1`) — the surface underneath is a live terminal that owns touch, so pinch fights the pane geometry instead of magnifying. Do not "fix" it; reflow is the accessibility path here |
| Live regions | `polite` for routine updates; `assertive` / `role="alert"` reserved for urgent errors only |

**Documented exception — no skip link.** The keyboard jump layer (command palette ⇧⌘P, hint overlay `f`/⌘G, task switcher Option+Tab) replaces a skip link. Future audits must not re-flag this as missing.

### 9a.2 Contrast — `Proposed`

APCA |Lc| ≥ 75 for body text, ≥ 60 for non-body text, ≥ 15 for non-text elements that must be discernible (borders, resize grips). WCAG 4.5:1 / 3:1 are acceptable fallback vocabulary.

**Measure the rendered pair in both themes** — not the token against its opaque fallback. Alpha-modified tokens (`bg-raised/65`, `border-danger/30`, `bg-fg-muted/40`) must be composited through the real layer stack before the pair is checked.

A token whose role is "text" is not a fill, and vice versa.

The repo carries an automated contrast check over the design-token pairs; any new pair must be added to that fixture before shipping.

### 9a.3 Typography — `Proposed`

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Closed type scale | Named rungs only; `text-[…]` arbitrary sizes banned (they silently inherit ancestor line-height) |
| Dense chrome minimum | After `MOBILE_DENSE_FACTOR` (~0.67×) in `zoom.ts`, meaning-bearing text needs a px-pinned floor; one bounded dense tier (weight ≥ 500, non-essential or duplicated copy only) is legitimate rather than pretending a uniform 12px floor applies everywhere |
| `tabular-nums` | Required on every value that changes in place: counters, diff stats, gauges, timers, LOC totals, percentages, chart axes — make it a property of the badge/stat primitive, not per callsite |
| Truncation | An identifier (branch, path, URL, PR ref) or error message may only be clamped when the full value is reachable on the same surface (tooltip, expand, or copy) |
| Heading levels | Map to scale rungs once, centrally |
| `line-height` | `leading-none` for single-line non-wrapping chrome only; anything that can wrap is `leading-snug` minimum; `≥1.4` at three or more lines |
| Long-form columns | Changelog and help prose: cap the text column at ~65ch, not just the page |
| 16px inputs | Applies to **every** text-entry control in browser mode, not an allowlist of three types |

Litmus test: does the text stay readable on a 390px screen with the dense-factor applied?

### 9a.4 Copy — `Proposed`

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Confirmation buttons | Repeat the consequence; `confirmLabel` is **required** — the confirm service must reject a generic default so "OK" cannot come back |
| Error messages | Every error ends with an imperative next step; `{error}` is a parenthetical detail, never the whole message — see `en/kanban.ts` for the reference shape |
| Button voice | Verb-first, speaks to the reader ("you"), never as the reader ("I") |
| Capitalization | **Sentence case** for settings rows, buttons, tabs, menu items; Title Case only for frozen proper nouns (`To Do`, `AI Review`, `Your Review`, `PR Review`) |
| Empty states | Three parts: what this is → why useful → one action. "No X" alone is incomplete. Search empty states name the query and offer an exit |
| Toggle labels | Name what happens when the toggle is ON |
| Placeholders | Format examples; every field keeps a visible label |
| Settings paths in tips/help | Never spell a path in prose — declare the destination as data and let the carrier render the link. In tips: set `Tip.settingsSection` (`SettingsRouteSectionId`, `tips.ts`) and `TipCard` renders an "Open the setting" link via `OPEN_SETTINGS_SECTION_EVENT`. The same principle applies to help strings. |
| `(s)` | Defect — use `t.plural`. `...` is a defect — use `…` |

### 9a.5 Motion — `Proposed`

- **No `transition: all`** — name the properties explicitly.
- CSS transitions for interactive state changes (interruptible); keyframes for one-shot sequences only.
- **Motion budget:** a hover animation on a repeated control stays under ~3s per cycle and never blocks or delays the interaction it decorates. Looping while hovered is **allowed and deliberate** for the icon families (`tmx-`, `gtx-`, `hdr-`, `th-`): the loop is the personality of the surface, and it runs only while the cursor rests on that one icon.
- Prefer compositable properties (`transform`, `opacity`); paint properties like `stroke-dashoffset` are for genuinely one-shot moments.
- Motion is **never** the only feedback channel — every animated state change also has a static cue.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured everywhere.

### 9a.6 Layout grammar — `Proposed`

- Group with space, not lines; gap between groups ≥ 2× gap within a group.
- A control must look interactive next to static text.
- Every fixed-width overlay clamps: `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`. Absolutely-positioned portals clamp and flip against `innerWidth`.
- Breakpoints come from content; a surface that shares the viewport with another uses `useContainerWidth` per §12.1's rule.
- Plan for string growth: p90 expansion en → ru/es is ~1.9× on short labels (`Retry` → `Попробовать ещё раз` is 3.8×). No fixed heights on label-bearing controls — use `min-h` instead.

## 10. Placement rules — `Observed`/`Inferred`

| Feature class | Place in | Reject | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| destination | global header, menu `View`, sidebar | card, modal, toolbar | navigation = places, not commands |
| object_action (single task) | inspector, card context menu, menu `Task` | global header, dashboard chrome | actions belong to the object surface |
| object_action — the one dashboard exception | the dashboard's own **task row**, at the row end: **exactly one ✓ Complete**, hover/focus-revealed on desktop, always visible and ≥44×44 on narrow; always routed through the terminal-move confirmation (`alwaysConfirm`), absent on hibernated tasks | a second row action, a per-row kebab or context menu on the dashboard, the same action in the project header or dashboard chrome | the dashboard is the *attention triage* list — every row is there because it waits on the user, and clearing a finished one is the job that screen exists for. The row **is** the task's surface (it already navigates to the task), so this is not app chrome. Capped at one: the moment a second action lands, the row needs a menu and the triage list becomes a second board (issue #1252) |
| git_action | inspector (frequent), menu `Project` (rare) | header, card inline | git surface is already dense |
| configuration | global/project settings | board, inspector, toolbar | durable behavior lives in settings |
| destructive | context menu, confirm, danger zone, overflow | primary button, header | needs friction + destructive styling |
| debug surface | menu `Debug` | header, dashboard, sidebar | dev surfaces must not leak to users |
| diagnostic surface (crash/error) | error boundary around providers, bootstrap phase+timeout state, conditional floating pill (remote + errorCount>0) → `DiagnosticsPanel` | permanent header/toolbar button, nav destination, desktop-shell chrome | faults must be visible where there is no devtools (mobile) without adding happy-path chrome (see §5.5) |
| transport health (`status`) | conditional floating pill in `StatusDock` (remote + transport unhealthy), tap = reconnect, ~2.5s success confirmation on recovery; per-screen skeleton / retry-panel / self-heal refetch for the data it blocks | header status dot or banner (permanent chrome + layout shift), a toast (transient — the condition persists), silence until the 120s RPC timeout | a dropped socket must be visible and retryable for as long as it lasts, without adding happy-path chrome (see §5.5) |
| ambient resource telemetry (`status`) — host-machine capacity the user spends by launching work | **permanent** global-header readout (≤1, see §5 budget), framed as *headroom left* not *usage*, colour driven by the OS's own pressure verdict; hover/tap → popover (desktop) / BottomSheet (narrow) with the who-took-it breakdown, own-app share stated separately from the agent share; the same numbers repeated as a **non-blocking** banner at the launch decision point (create-task, launch-variants) | a fault-style conditional pill (this is not a fault — it is a continuous decision input), a percentage threshold we invented instead of the OS signal, a bare quantity labelled only "memory", blocking/gating a launch, toasts or attention badges on pressure, memory history/graphs on the cockpit, **any action on memory we do not own** (top consumers are read-only — we do not kill the user's browser) | unlike transport health and diagnostics (faults → conditional chrome, §5.5), capacity is useful on the happy path: the user builds an intuition for *normal* only by seeing it when nothing is wrong, and needs it with zero tasks running. Same class as the prevent-sleep toggle (always-on ambient machine state, `--awake`), not the same class as an error indicator. It also exists to answer a blame question honestly — so the app's own share must never be flattered (decision 2026-07-30) |
| unbounded object-scoped log (agent-appended notes, run history) | the object's surface keeps a **capped, per-entry-clamped preview** (newest 3 + count + one `Show all N` row); the full log lives in its own overlay — `BottomSheet` on narrow, dialog on wide (see §5.8) | rendering the whole log inline "because it usually fits", moving the whole section behind a tap, a nav destination for it, virtualization instead of a cap | the distribution is the argument: the median object holds one short entry and the tail holds hundreds, so both hiding everything and showing everything are wrong. Cap + clamp keeps the common case free and bounds the tail without a scroll wall (decision 2026-08-14) |
| hint navigation (jump) | `HintOverlay` over any `[data-hint-id]` target; activate with bare `f` / `⌘G` | mutation or destructive targets, visible button | hints are destinations, not actions; keyboard-only avoids button-creep |
| keyboard expert nav | bare-key + `g`-prefix sequences (`g d/p/t/s`), `/` focus search, `c` new task — declared in `keymap.ts`, matched on `e.code` | native menu accelerators (Electrobun can't bind chords/sequences) | layout-independent; reserve `g` for the go-to prefix |
| countable/motivational metric (`data_visualization`) | emit into the stats engine first (`productivity-stats.ts` + `productivityStats.ts`), then a viz on the Velocity Cockpit (`stats`) | controls/config on the cockpit, a new top-level screen per metric, a header counter, diagnostic noise | the cockpit is the one home for shipping signal — keep it read-only and within the honesty/complexity budget (see §1.1) |
| onboarding_help (inline help) | `help.ts` registry topic reachable in help mode (`data-help-id` zone; HelpSpot auto-registers as one); HelpSpot in a header-bearing section, or — earned — on a surprising form field's label; entries in menu `Help` / header (?) / `⇧⌘/` / palette. **Coverage owed:** new user-facing UI ships its topic + zone in the same commit | permanent (i) in quickbars/cards/toolbars or on every form field, a `data-help-id`/`topicId` without a registry topic (silent no-op), hardcoded help strings in components, multi-step tours (v1) | the UI is the product's only teaching channel — coverage is mandatory but chrome-free (help mode is the master surface); permanent (i) stays budgeted; content is data, not JSX (see §5.4) |
| feature-gated preset | keep visible in the launch picker but **disabled** (muted + lock) until the gating capability is on; disabled-click → clickable toast that deep-links to the enabling settings section (`OPEN_SETTINGS_SECTION_EVENT` → `Route.section`); the capability's manager is a normal settings section | hiding the preset until enabled, auto-starting the dependency on selection, a bespoke modal | discoverable without a hidden side effect; configuration lives in settings (decision 112) |
| privacy-sensitive display value (identity/secret) | render through the streamer-mode masking pattern: `streamer-private` / `streamer-private-media` class (or the `Private` wrapper, `src/mainview/streamer-mode.tsx`) so `data-streamer="on"` blurs it; the toggle itself is `configuration` (Settings → Appearance, `local` storage) + a `⇧⌘P` palette command + a `?streamer=on\|off` URL param (machine entry point — agent QA screenshots are ALWAYS masked, per AGENTS.md) | an unmasked email/org/home-path/tunnel-URL/QR on a new surface, a header quick-toggle button (chrome creep), hover-to-reveal (leaks live on stream) | recordings/screenshots are a first-class use (the developer demos the app); masking is CSS-only so coverage is one class per value, and every new identity-bearing surface is OWED the class in the same commit (decision 161) |
| privacy-sensitive **object** (a whole project the user must not show on camera) | one `Project.sensitive` toggle in Project Settings → **Board** tab, own `SettingsSection` (it is project-record state, so it must not live in the git-committed Project/Worktree config tabs). While `data-streamer="on"`: the project's **name** and **every task of it** carry `streamer-private` on the text container wherever they render outside the project (dashboard rows, breadcrumb, pickers, task switcher, tmux session manager); its dashboard row / picker option stays **visible but non-selectable** (`aria-disabled`, lock glyph, `cursor-not-allowed`), a blocked click fires one clickable toast that deep-links to Settings → Appearance; the single `navigate()` choke point in `App.tsx` refuses any route into it and turning streamer mode on while inside it redirects to `dashboard`; every notification path (native, web, toast, bell/attention) drops its events at the bun-side `deliverTaskNotification` gate plus the renderer-side toast gate. **Documented exception to CSS-only masking:** `document.title` cannot be blurred, so a sensitive project's title prefix is *replaced* with a neutral placeholder | hiding the project from the dashboard (a project that silently vanishes reads as data loss), a card-wide blur that also blurs the lock affordance, a header "sensitive projects" indicator or counter (chrome creep — the lock on the row is the indicator), an unlock-per-session escape hatch, making the flag act outside streamer mode | the flag exists for one moment — the camera is on — and the failure it prevents is a single accidental click, so the guard belongs at the routing choke point rather than in each of the ~10 entry points; keeping the row visible-but-locked preserves the demo's continuity (decision 161's reason for blur over text replacement) while making the block self-explaining |
| find in content (`⌘F` search over what a viewer renders) | **Content toolbar exists** (diff viewer §5.3) → a toggle + inline box in that toolbar, beside the other content controls. **Full-bleed content, no content toolbar** (terminal canvas, artifact iframe) → the search UI is a **floating bar over the content**, top-right, gated on focus being inside that viewer; `⌘F` is the primary trigger and must be registered in `keymap.ts`. **One earned magnifier icon button** in the viewer header may toggle that bar (accent-tinted while open) — an explicit, user-requested exception to §11 button-creep, justified because a keyboard-only find is invisible on a mouse-driven viewer. It is a *trigger for content UI*, not a content control: it opens the floating bar and owns no state of its own | a search input living in the header, a second entry point per viewer beyond that one icon, a global find destination, a permanent always-visible search field over content | find is scoped to the *rendered document*, so the UI belongs where that document is, and `⌘F` is the universal muscle memory; gating on viewer focus leaves the browser's native find intact everywhere else in remote mode. The single icon buys discoverability for pointer users at the cost of one header slot — do not let unrelated controls inherit this exception |
| hand-off of viewed content to the OS (open in web browser) | the **viewer's own header**, one neutral icon-only button (external-link glyph) placed **immediately beside download** — the two are the same class: take this document out of dev3. Desktop hands the stored file path to the OS default browser through an RPC; browser/remote opens a blob URL of the already-composed document in a new tab, and the `window.open` must fire **synchronously inside the click** or the popup blocker eats it. Failure → toast, never a native dialog | a second entry point (context menu + header + inspector) for the same hand-off, an accent tint (it owns no state), a keyboard shortcut, gating the button on transport (both transports get a working path — only the mechanism differs) | a viewer is a reduced browser: real find, print, zoom, devtools and a window that survives navigating dev3 all live in the actual browser, so the escape hatch belongs on the document being viewed. It costs one header slot and is only earned next to an existing export control — the viewer header is now full (search, theme, download, open-in-browser, fullscreen, close); the next control replaces one |
| layout boundary manipulation (resize a split) | **on the boundary itself** — a `role="separator"` overlay strip centred on the split, hit target ≥ 9px, resting grip visible at rest (`bg-fg-muted/40`), accent on hover/focus/drag, `col-resize`/`row-resize` cursor, ghost line during drag and one commit on pointer-up. Zero toolbar slots, so it is exempt from §11 button-creep. Hidden when the split does not exist (single pane) or is not visible (zoomed pane, narrow one-at-a-time carousel) | a "Resize panes" toolbar/inspector button, a size dropdown, a numeric field, a renderer-only resize that is not persisted through the owning backend, live per-pointermove commits over a live TUI | a boundary is a direct-manipulation object: the affordance must sit where the hand already is, and a control for it elsewhere is pure chrome on a canvas that is otherwise chrome-free (§10 find-in-content row). A resting grip is the only thing that makes an invisible boundary discoverable; commit-on-release exists because every intermediate ratio would SIGWINCH every pane and repaint the whole TUI |
| launch favorite (quick-pick) | one compact **leading "Favorites" column** (peer to Provider/Model/Mode, with its own label so it aligns in-row) inside the launch picker (`AgentConfigPicker`, `showFavorites` on Launch/Retry, Spawn, Bug Hunters): a narrow fixed-width trigger showing a Nerd Font **star that fills gold** (`--favorite`) when the current `(agentId,configId)` is saved, opening a left-aligned portal **popover** (`FavoritesMenu`) — top row toggles **Save ↔ Remove** the current combo (gold when saved), below it the favorites list (apply on click, `×` per row removes, accent + check on the active one). Column is **always present** (save reachable at 0 favorites). NO persistent chip row, NO 1-click row star. Stored globally (`GlobalSettings.favorites`), cap 10, LFU-then-LRU eviction | a persistent chip row above the cascade (duplicates N× across variant pickers + vertical bloat), a right-side `[★│▾]` split (dangles below the Selects, misaligned), a 4th text dropdown eating width ×N, a favorites pseudo-provider, favorites in the Settings default-agent pickers, click-to-launch | the launch picker is instantiated **once per variant** in `LaunchVariantsModal`, so a persistent row rendered inside it duplicated the identical global list N times and pushed the cascade down; a leading labeled column with a narrow star trigger keeps favorites one earned icon (button-creep budget §11), aligned in-row, zero added height, and each trigger unambiguously targets its own picker (decision 125, sibling to 112) |

## 11. Known anti-patterns in this project

- **Toolbar button creep** — the changelog shows repeated additions of always-visible git/tmux/dev-server buttons (`always-visible-git-buttons`, `tmux-action-buttons`, `push-button`, `create-pr-button`, …). `TaskInfoPanel` (34K) and `TaskCard` (33K) are the pressure points. For `TaskInfoPanel`, follow the §5.1 bar model: assign each new control to one domain bar; do not pile everything into row-1-right. Group or overflow before adding.
- **Dangling or orphan help** — a `data-help-id`/`topicId` no registry topic backs (a silent no-op: HelpSpot renders nothing, help mode skips the zone — the 2026-07 settings re-org silently lost help for three categories this way), or a registry topic no component mounts (dead copy). One registry, help mode is the master surface; `help.test.ts` guards both directions. See §5.4.
- **Hardcoded colors** — raw hex/rgb instead of semantic tokens (forbidden except `STATUS_COLORS`).
- **Colour token that shadows a font-size rung** — a key in `theme.extend.colors` whose name matches a `fontSize` rung makes Tailwind emit `.text-<name>` twice, as a size *and* as a colour; the colour wins and repaints everything that only meant to set the size. `base` did this and left 107 icon glyphs drawn in the page background colour. Guarded by `tailwind-token-collisions.test.ts`; see [decision 206](../../decisions/2026/08/06/base-color-token-shadowed-text-base.md).
- **Untranslated strings** — UI strings must use `t()` and exist in en/ru/es.
- **Actions in breadcrumbs** — header is location + switching only.
- **Debug-surface leak** — `gauge-demo` / `viewport-lab` outside the Debug menu.
- **Touch-unreachable feature** — an action whose only path is a keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K/Cmd+Shift+P/Cmd+1..9/hint overlay) or the native application menu. On narrow (<768) it is dead, because the native menu is absent in remote and there is no keyboard. Every feature needs a touch path (palette touch entry, action sheet, or inline control). See §12.4.
- **Fixed-width overlay on narrow** — a `Modal`/palette/popover with a hardcoded `w-[NNrem]` and no `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` overflows a 390px phone (`PaletteShell` 34rem, `TaskDetailModal` 35rem, `confirm()` 26rem, diff aside 22rem). Overlays must clamp to the viewport on narrow. See §12.3.
- **Non-wrapping toolbar on narrow** — an icon/action row (`flex … justify-end` / `justify-between`, no `flex-wrap`) that silently overflows under 768px (GlobalHeader ≤9 buttons, TaskCard footer, inspector collapsed bar). On narrow, wrap or move to a bottom sheet — never a clipped row. See §12.6.
- **Hover-reveal as a control's only visibility state** — `opacity-0` → `group-hover:opacity-100` on an action cluster means the action does not exist for anyone who has not already found it, and it dies on touch. Every control needs a resting emphasis level; hover *raises* emphasis (tone step + hover surface), it never creates the control. Same reasoning as the resting split-resize grip in §10. Reference: the Dashboard project-row cluster (`ProjectActionButtons.tsx`), which rests at `text-fg-3` and lifts to `text-fg` + `bg-elevated` per button.
- **Gating layout on `isElectrobun` instead of width** — transport ≠ viewport width. Browser/remote can be wide; desktop can be narrowed. Gate layout on `useNarrowViewport`; use `isElectrobun`/`useMobile` only for transport/viewport-meta decisions. See §12.1.

## 12. Narrow-viewport (mobile) doctrine — board `Observed`, rest `Proposed`

The app's secondary form factor is a **phone reached over `dev3 remote`** (any sub-768px viewport: a phone browser, a narrowed desktop browser window, or a hypothetical Electrobun-mobile build). The desktop UI is dense, wide, and keyboard-first; it must **degrade to a touch-first, one-thing-at-a-time form** on narrow screens — without becoming a second app. This section is the canonical ruleset; the Kanban board carousel (Ittai Zeidman's idea) is the **reference implementation** the rest generalises from. Full plans preserved in git history (removed feature-plans/).

**The one principle:** *On a narrow viewport, show exactly one sibling at a time and move between siblings by swipe + a visible pager.* Columns, tasks-in-a-column, terminal panes, active tasks, settings sections, diff files — all collapse to the same one-at-a-time carousel/stack idiom. This is a **responsive view-mode of existing screens**, never a new destination, nav item, route, or "mobile mode" setting. Layout follows the viewport automatically.

### 12.1 Breakpoint ladder — `Observed` (reconciled)

Three distinct widths exist in code; they are **not** the same thing and must not be conflated:

| Name | Width | Hook / signal | Reactive? | Governs |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **narrow (mobile)** | `< 768px` | `useNarrowViewport(768)` (matchMedia, `CAROUSEL_MAX_WIDTH`) | yes | **the mobile doctrine** — carousel/stack/sheet layout switch. This is THE gate. Aligns with Tailwind `md`. |
| **compact** | `< 1600px` | `useCompact()` (`COMPACT_MAX_WIDTH`) | yes | dense-desktop label hiding + header overflow kebab; **not** mobile. A wide-but-not-huge desktop is compact, not narrow. |
| **device-class** | `screen.width < 1024` | `useMobile()` | no (mount-once) | viewport-meta decision plus the **portrait-only device guard** — is this physically a small device. NOT a layout gate. |
| **container width** | per-surface | `useContainerWidth(ref)` (ResizeObserver) | yes | a surface that shares the viewport with another one (the inspector beside the board) — its own box, not the window. Use it whenever a viewport breakpoint would lie. |

Rules: **gate layout on `useNarrowViewport`** (reactive, viewport-width). Use `useMobile()` for the `<meta viewport>` choice and the portrait-only device guard. Never gate a layout on `isElectrobun` (transport ≠ width) — browser mode can be wide, desktop can be narrowed. `useViewport()` serves **device-width** to the browser so a phone reports its true width and the media queries fire (the old fixed `width=1024` is replaced). The earlier "sub-1024 / `useMobile`" wording was wrong for layout — the shipped layout gate is **768 / `useNarrowViewport`**.

**Portrait-only device guard — `Observed`:** A physically small device is locked to portrait when the browser permits the Screen Orientation API. If the lock is unsupported or rejected outside fullscreen, `MobilePortraitGate` blocks the root shell in landscape with a localized rotate-to-portrait prompt and makes the underlying app inert. Narrowed desktop windows are unaffected because they are not the mobile device class.

### 12.2 The one-at-a-time pattern + gesture law

| Surface class | Narrow form | Swipe rule |
|---|---|---|
| **scroll-body** (board columns, lists, settings sections) | one sibling = 100vw via CSS `scroll-snap`; the body scrolls on the *other* axis | **full-surface swipe allowed** — the body scrolls vertically only, so horizontal motion is unambiguous (delegate axis disambiguation to the browser) |
| **live-content** (terminal pane, diff stream, any canvas/TUI) | one element + a position indicator (dots) | **full-surface swipe allowed, but axis-arbitrated** — the content consumes touch (vim/htop/less, code scroll), so the handler claims a gesture only once it is *clearly horizontal* (capture-phase `preventDefault`+`stopPropagation`, cancel any nascent selection); vertical drags and taps fall through to the content. Native `scroll-snap` can't do this (a canvas has no sibling slides) → manual gesture. *(Revised 2026-06-29 — was "swipe forbidden, pager only"; a bottom pager bar collides with the mobile keyboard. See decision 089.)* |

**Gesture law (always):** every swipe has a **button + keyboard equivalent** (pager chevrons, dots, Arrow Left/Right); swipe is never the only way. Focus follows the active sibling's heading; `aria-live` announces it. `prefers-reduced-motion` snaps instantly (no smooth scroll) — honoured everywhere, not just the carousel (see §12.7).

### 12.3 Per-surface adaptation map — `Observed` (board) / `Proposed` (rest)

Every surface from §5 gets an explicit narrow form. "—" = unchanged.

| Surface | Desktop form | Narrow (<768) form | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile orientation | natural device orientation | **portrait-only device guard**; best-effort platform lock plus a blocking rotate prompt fallback in landscape | `Observed` (`MobilePortraitGate`, `usePortraitOrientation`) |
| Kanban board | compact equal-width columns; contextual review columns appear only while occupied | **column carousel** (one status/screen, swipe; vertical task scroll; empty persistent columns kept) | `Observed` |
| Workspace board | project swimlanes under one sticky lifecycle header | **status carousel**; each slide stacks project sections vertically | `Observed` |
| Task move (drag) | drag card across columns | drag impossible → **"Move to <status>" action sheet** (long-press card) on the existing status path; completion reuses `confirmTaskCompletion` | `Proposed` |
| Board filters/search | inline `LabelFilterBar` + `FilterFunnel` dropdown (token-DSL) | **bottom sheet** behind the funnel button (same grouped facets) | `Proposed` |
| Terminal panes | tiled tmux panes | **pane carousel** — one zoomed pane + axis-arbitrated horizontal swipe over the terminal, a slim non-overlapping top dots strip, Arrow keys; keep-zoom via `tmuxPaneNavigate` (`MobilePaneCarousel.tsx`) | `Observed` |
| Terminal windows | tmux windows (workspaces) | **window switcher** — a slim ‹ prev · named dropdown · next › bar ABOVE the pane bar, buttons + dropdown + Arrow-while-focused (no swipe; the terminal swipe is the pane carousel's). Renders only when window count > 1; via `tmuxWindowNavigate` (`MobileWindowCarousel.tsx`) | `Observed` |
| Terminal text input (touch) | direct typing into the focused terminal | **docked composer** (gate = `!isElectrobun && isTouchDevice`, NOT width — an input-model switch): terminal tap never summons the OSK; an autogrow chat-style composer between the terminal and `ExtraKeyBar` owns text entry (Send = mode-2004-aware paste + Enter; Insert = paste only; expand state for long prompts; terminal tail stays visible); sticky `⌨` **raw** toggle on `ExtraKeyBar` restores direct typing + select-to-copy/TUI mouse; covers Quick Shell too. See `UX_DECISIONS.md` (2026-07-02) | `Proposed` |
| Active tasks | `ActiveTasksSidebar` (split, 240px) | no persistent task strip; use the existing task-switcher overlay and breadcrumb → board carousel to change tasks | `Observed` (strip removed 2026-07-19) |
| Task inspector (`TaskInfoPanel`, 2×2 bars) | 2×2 quickbar grid | the 2×2 cannot fit — collapse to **one summary bar + a "task actions" bottom sheet** (the bars' actions become sheet sections); metadata grid already reflows | `Proposed` |
| Diff viewer | 22rem files-aside + diff stream | **stack/one-at-a-time** — files-aside becomes a bottom-sheet file picker; the diff stream owns the screen (live-content: pager/explicit nav, no full-surface swipe). The four mutually exclusive diff modes (Branch / Uncommitted / Unpushed / Last N) are a segmented control, and four long labels cannot share a phone row: they collapse to **one trigger naming the active mode → `BottomSheet` of the four options**, per §12.6's shed-never-stack rule | `Proposed` |
| Modal (`*Modal`) | fixed 26–35rem centered | **full-bleed sheet**: `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)]` (or bottom-sheet for action-style modals) | `Proposed` |
| Context menu (right-click) | popup at cursor | **bottom action sheet** (long-press trigger) | `Proposed` |
| Settings (left-nav + detail) | left-nav Settings categories + one category detail pane; localized search groups registered Settings entries | **category list first → one category detail at a time** with a visible back affordance; same route and persistence, no horizontal overflow | `Observed` (`GlobalSettings.tsx`, `settings-registry.ts`) |
| Dashboard | Board / Projects sibling tabs; Projects retains the activity list and project controls | same tabs; Board becomes the status carousel, Projects remains a vertical list | `Observed` |
| Command palette (Cmd+K / Cmd+Shift+P) | keyboard-summoned, `34rem` | needs a **touch entry** + `w-full max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` — see §12.4 (it is the action fallback for the absent native menu) | `Proposed` |
| Global header | single row, ≤9 utility buttons | reflow: logo + truncated breadcrumb + **one overflow (kebab)** for all utilities; never a 9-icon row (`useCompact` at 1600 only hides labels, it does not reflow for 390px) | `Observed` |
| Hover terminal preview | popover on card hover | **disabled** on touch/narrow (no hover; popover obscures) — already gated in `useTerminalPreview` | `Observed` |
| Task image viewer | lightbox + thumbnail rail | full-bleed; filmstrip → bottom scroll strip; image is live-content (axis-arbitrated swipe + prev/next + dots); touch entry = inspector badge + palette action | `Proposed` |
| Task artifact workspace | resizable panel beside terminal | one-at-a-time: artifact replaces terminal content; close returns to terminal; fullscreen remains available | `Observed` |
| Toast | top-right, clamped | already `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` — OK | `Observed` (OK) |

### 12.4 Navigation & action reachability on touch — `Proposed`

Mobile's hardest gap: **the keyboard-first nav layer is dead on a touchscreen, and the native application menu is absent in remote mode.** Keyboard-only and therefore unusable on a phone: Cmd+K / Cmd+Shift+P palettes, Cmd+1..9 project switch, the Cmd+/ hint overlay. The native menu (task moves, git, dev-server) does not exist in the browser at all.

Doctrine:
- **The breadcrumb spine stays the touch nav backbone**: logo→dashboard, project name→board, project chevron→switcher dropdown, back/forward. These must remain reachable (not pushed off-screen by a long task title) — give the project switcher a touch-sized target (≥44px) and a `right-0` fallback so the dropdown never clips.
- **The command palette gains a touch entry on narrow** (a single search/jump affordance) and a responsive width. Because the native menu is gone in remote, the **action palette / per-object action sheets become the canonical action surface on mobile** — every action that on desktop lives only in the native menu must be reachable on mobile via a palette entry or an object action sheet. This is the one sanctioned exception to "palettes are keyboard-only / no button" — on narrow, a touch entry is mandatory, not button-creep.
- **The browser application menu bar is a wide-layout surface**: hide its standalone row below 768px so the existing GlobalHeader `More` bottom sheet and command palette remain the compact touch entry points; desktop/browser menu parity is unchanged.
- **No feature may be touch-unreachable.** If an action's only desktop path is a keyboard shortcut or the native menu, it MUST have a touch path on narrow (action sheet, palette, or inline control).

### 12.5 Overlay primitive — `BottomSheet` — `Observed`

`BottomSheet` is the narrow rendering for: context-menu→action-sheet, board filters, column-jump list, "Move to", the inspector actions sheet, the diff file picker, and the narrow form of action-style modals. It slides from the bottom, respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`, traps focus, restores focus on close, and dismisses on backdrop tap / swipe-down / Esc. A pure React component — works identically in desktop and browser (no native dialog, per the no-native-dialogs rule). Do not scatter ad-hoc sheets.

Evidence: `BottomSheet.tsx` — used by `GlobalHeader` narrow kebab, `ActivityOverview` project action sheet, `MobilePaneCarousel` manage sheet. `prefers-reduced-motion` suppresses the slide animation (`bottom-sheet-panel` in `index.css`).

### 12.6 Narrow complexity budgets & touch targets — `Proposed`

| Surface | Narrow budget | Overflow rule |
|---|---|---|
| Global header utilities | logo + breadcrumb + **1** overflow kebab + **≤1 ambient resource readout** | everything else into the kebab/sheet |
| Page primary action | 1 (a FAB or header button) | rest into a bottom sheet |
| Inspector | 1 summary bar (+ conditional output readouts) | all *actions* into the actions sheet |
| Any toolbar/action row | **shed, never stack** — one row that drops its lowest-priority items in a declared order; wrapping to a second row is not an option | shed item moves to the bottom sheet |
| Touch target | **≥ 44×44px** for standalone/primary controls and sheet rows; the global coarse-pointer floor is 24×24 (WCAG 2.5.8) | bump primary controls per surface — a blanket 44px floor inflates inline chips and badges and wrecks card layout |

**A control row sheds; it never stacks.** A second row costs the phone a whole band of screen and moves every control the user was aiming at — worse than losing the least important one. So every narrow control row is `flex-nowrap`, carries a written priority order, and drops from the bottom of that order as width runs out. Two consequences are binding: **anything shed must already have a sheet path** (drop it only when that path exists, or add the sheet row in the same change), and **the last survivors must degrade by truncation, not by clipping** — the row's flexible text gets `min-w-0` + `truncate`, so an unusually long custom-column name shortens instead of pushing the kebab off-screen. Thresholds are container queries on the row itself (`[container-type:inline-size]`), not viewport breakpoints: the row, not the window, is what runs out of room.

**Conditional agent-output readouts stay on the inspector summary bar — until the bar cannot hold them.** The diff badge, `Images` and `Artifacts` are not folded into the sheet by default: they exist only when the task actually produced that output, they carry an unread state, and their whole value is being *seen* without opening a menu — the same status-not-action logic as the header's ambient readout, and the sibling of the desktop Runtime-bar exception in §5.1. They sit next to priority, render at the 44px touch target, and are **also** kept as sheet rows, because the sheet is the phone's complete action inventory. That sheet row is what makes them sheddable: below the width where the bar fits, they drop in the order diff badge → artifacts → images, and the status label goes icon-only before anything is clipped. Only agent outputs inherit the resting-visible part; an ordinary action still folds unconditionally.

**The ambient readout is a desktop-width slot, and it is capped at one.** On roomy widths the header carries exactly one ambient resource readout (currently memory headroom), because a *status* earns its place by being seen without looking. On narrow it folds into the kebab sheet with `PreventSleepToggle` / `RateLimitIndicator`: a phone header has room for the breadcrumb and one kebab, and a number nobody acts on at a glance is the first thing that should give that room back. Inside the sheet it keeps the 44×44px touch target and opens its breakdown as a BottomSheet, not a floating popover.

**The breakdown carries destructive actions, and only over memory we are wasting.** Leftover processes still running inside task worktrees — an agent's detached headless browser, a watcher, a dev build that outlived its task — are the app's own leak, so the popover that already refuses to flatter our share also has to let the user reclaim it: a **conditional** fifth section at the bottom of the dev3 group, gated on `count > 0`. Three controls, no more: `Kill all` in the section header, a per-row kill revealed on hover/focus, and a rescan icon. All ghost-danger, never primary fill. **Confirmation is priced by blast radius, not by the word "kill":** `Kill all` sweeps tasks the user may have scrolled past, so it asks first (`confirm({ danger: true })`, popover closed before the dialog opens); a row is one named task whose count is already on screen, so it fires immediately and the row vanishing is the receipt. There is deliberately **no** reassuring empty state — a permanent "nothing leaking" line trains the eye to skip the region, and the section means something precisely because it only appears when it is true. The scan is on-demand (popover open, plus once at startup for the log), never in the memory poller: it costs an `lsof` snapshot of the whole process table. **Startup detects and never kills** — the app does not end a user's process without a click, and a worktree still claimed by a live task may legitimately hold a browser an agent is using right now, so tasks with a live session are excluded from the list entirely. This exception is narrow and does not generalise — it exists because the memory is *ours*; the top-consumer rows above it stay read-only forever.

### 12.7 Accessibility, motion, input — `Proposed`

- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion` on every animated transition. `index.css` covers toast-swipe, bottom-sheet slide, close-pane marching-ants, and several icon-animation families; `useReducedMotion` is used in gauges, git/dev-server spinners, launch modals, and skeleton loaders. The carousel was the first; it is no longer the only one.
- Keep the `.browser-mode` 16px input-font rule (prevents iOS focus-zoom); honour `env(safe-area-inset-*)` (the viewport already sets `viewport-fit=cover`).
- Reuse the `TerminalView` touch→mouse bridge model for any canvas surface; reuse `ExtraKeyBar`'s vw-based sizing for mobile toolbars.
- Carousels: `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, siblings as `group`/`tabpanel`, pager as the tablist; arrow-key support when the pager is focused.

## 13. Open questions

- Multi-select + a real selection toolbar on the board, or is per-task action intentional?
- Add an `--info` token, or keep reusing accent (blue)?
- `ProjectSettings` (59.9K) is still very large — does it need a documented sub-surface budget or splitting? (`TaskInfoPanel` is now governed by the §5.1 bar model.)
- Should status colors migrate to named theme tokens, or stay as the documented hex exception?
- Narrow nav: is a persistent bottom tab bar (Dashboard · Board · Task · More) the right touch nav spine, or do the breadcrumb + a touch palette entry suffice? (§12.4)
- Does the mobile primary action want a FAB, or stay in the (reflowed) header? One per screen either way. (§12.6)
- Should `useMobile()` become reactive (it is mount-once at 1024) so the viewport-meta decision tracks live resizes, or is mount-once acceptable since device class rarely changes mid-session? (§12.1)

## 14. Glossary

Shared UX vocabulary, specialized for this project (was `UX_GLOSSARY.md`).

- **Destination** — a stable place users navigate to; in dev-3.0 a **screen** in the `Route` union (`dashboard`, `project`, `task`, `settings`, …), not a URL.
- **Action** — a command that changes state or performs work: primary, object, git, dev-server, lifecycle, configuration, destructive, expert-shortcut.
- **Surface** — a UI container that owns a class of interaction: global header, application menu (native), Kanban board, task card, task info panel (inspector), modal, popover, context menu, settings, sidebar, toast.
- **Primary action** — the one main safe action for the current screen/flow. Styled `bg-accent-fill`. Max one visible per screen.
- **Destructive action** — delete, remove, cancel, reset, hard refresh. Styled `text-danger`/`bg-danger`, requires confirmation, never primary styling.
- **Configuration** — a durable change to project/app behavior (scripts, columns, labels, theme, locale, gh account). Lives in Global or Project Settings.
- **Settings category** — one of the eight Global Settings navigation items: Appearance, Tasks & Board, Keyboard, Terminal, Agents, Accounts, Workspace, or System.
- **Settings entry** — a registry-described individual setting with localized title/description metadata and an optional scroll anchor; its bespoke control remains owned by the category surface.
- **Complexity budget** — a project-specific cap on visible controls per surface (e.g. ≤2 inline actions on a task card, ≤4 visible toolbar actions); exists because of dev-3.0's documented toolbar-button-creep history.
- **Inspector** — the `TaskInfoPanel`: the contextual control surface for the active task (git, dev server, scripts, notes, tmux, open-in). The densest surface in the app.
- **Variant / Attempt** — multiple parallel agent runs of the same task (a *variant group*, shared `groupId`/seq; "group" is reserved for this concept — feature grouping is **Epic**). Each variant stays its own honest card; group affordance is one unified pattern on both card surfaces: **≤ 3 clickable status dots** (self ring-highlighted + lowest indexes, no `+N`) opening the **SiblingPopover** group overview (per-variant title, agent/config, status, current marker), plus the inspector Context-bar **variant switcher** and the `⇧⌘[`/`⇧⌘]` cycle for in-workspace switching. Never collapse a group into one card.
- **Custom column** — a user-defined Kanban column with a name, color, optional LLM instruction, and optional auto-spawn agent config.
- **Token** — a semantic CSS custom property (`bg-accent`, `text-fg`, `border-edge`, `--success`…) mapped to Tailwind; components must use tokens, never raw hex — except `STATUS_COLORS`.
- **Status color** — per-status hex (`STATUS_COLORS` / `STATUS_COLORS_LIGHT`) used inline for column headers, card borders, and dots; the one documented exception to the no-hardcoded-color rule.
