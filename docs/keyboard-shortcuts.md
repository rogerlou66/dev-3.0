# Keyboard shortcuts

Press **⌘/** (**Ctrl+/** on Linux) inside the app — or open **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** — to
see every shortcut in one panel (App + Terminal/tmux tabs). This page mirrors that panel.

The single source of truth is [`src/mainview/keymap.ts`](../src/mainview/keymap.ts); the overlay,
this page and the website all read from it.

### In a browser (`dev3 remote`)

Two rules shape the keymap there, and both are enforced in
[`src/mainview/keymap.ts`](../src/mainview/keymap.ts):

- **The browser keeps some combos** — ⌘W, ⌘T, ⌘N, ⌘1–9, ⌘0, F11, zoom, refresh — and a page cannot
  cancel them. Those bindings do not fire in remote; the panel shows the alternative instead
  (`G` then `1–9` for projects, `G` then `0` for Operations, `C` for a new task, `⌃B x` / `⌃B c` for
  panes). **⇧⌘Space always opens the Command Palette**, and every action is a command — so nothing is
  out of reach even where a combo is lost.
- **The shell keeps `Ctrl`** — on Windows and Linux the app modifier is Ctrl, and `^D`, `^W`, `^K`,
  `^[` belong to whatever runs in the terminal. No app shortcut fires while a terminal has focus
  there, and the pane keys sit on `Ctrl+Shift` instead, as in every terminal emulator.

**Fullscreen in a Chromium browser lifts the first rule entirely:** the app calls
[`navigator.keyboard.lock()`](../src/mainview/keyboard-lock.ts) and ⌘W/⌘T/⌘1–9 become the app's
again, so the desktop keymap works verbatim. Escape is deliberately left to the browser so a single
press still leaves fullscreen. Safari and Firefox do not implement the API — there the alternatives
above are the whole story.

## Terminal

On a task whose terminal runs on the **tmux** backend, multiplexing uses tmux's `⌃B` prefix
bindings — see the **Terminal (tmux)** tab in the in-app panel for the current set. They are
defined in [`src/bun/tmux-config.ts`](../src/bun/tmux-config.ts). A task on the **native**
backend has no tmux and therefore no `⌃B` prefix; its panes are driven from the app's own
controls (and, for agents, `dev3 pane`).
