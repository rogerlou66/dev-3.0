# Sign the locally-built CLI binaries on macOS.
#
# Why: `bun build --compile` produces a Mach-O with an embedded payload that
# Apple's `codesign` rejects with "invalid or unsupported format for signature".
# On macOS Sequoia (24+) AMFI then SIGKILLs unsigned binaries even when run
# locally — the symptom is `[1] killed ./dist/dev3` with no output.
# The fix is to first strip the bun-emitted pseudo-blob with
# `codesign --remove-signature`, then sign the clean Mach-O.
#
# Default mode is an ad-hoc signature — enough to satisfy AMFI for local
# testing on the dev machine. When `ELECTROBUN_DEVELOPER_ID` is present
# (release CI), sign the CLI binary with the real Developer ID before
# Electrobun copies it into the app bundle.
#
# No-op on Linux/Windows/CI without macOS — they don't need a signature.
