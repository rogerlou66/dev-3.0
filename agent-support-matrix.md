# Agent Support Matrix

Feature compatibility across supported AI coding agents.

## Status Hooks

Injected per-worktree at task launch.

### Claude Code

Injected into `.claude/settings.local.json`.

| Hook event | Status transition | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | → `in-progress` | User sent a message, agent starts working |
| `PreToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Agent is about to call a tool (also catches post-permission resume) |
| `PostToolUse` | → `in-progress` | A tool finished, including answers submitted to `AskUserQuestion` |
| `PermissionRequest` | → `user-questions` | Agent needs user approval for a tool call |
| `Stop` | → `review-by-user` | Agent finished its turn |
| `StopFailure` | → `user-questions` | An API error (usage limit, auth, billing, server) ended the turn. Fires **instead of** `Stop`, so without it the task would keep claiming the agent is working. Routed through `dev3 hook claude-stop-failure`, which also raises the attention badge and a desktop notification naming the reset time |

Codex has no equivalent event — a Codex session that runs out of quota is still only visible in the rate-limit indicator.

### Codex

Generated in each task's `.codex/hooks.json` and enabled via `~/.codex/config.toml` (`[features] hooks = true` on Codex 0.129+, `codex_hooks = true` before that). Current Codex deliberately reads project hooks from the root checkout instead of a linked worktree, so dev3 also injects the same definitions as session flags into every Codex pane. On Codex 0.129+, dev3 asks `hooks/list` for authoritative hashes and adds trust state to that session override only; it never changes `~/.codex/hooks.json`, persists hook trust, or trusts unrelated user/project/plugin hooks. The Codex skill forbids duplicate manual normal-lifecycle moves; semantic questions, custom columns, and explicit completion remain manual. `PermissionRequest` runs on Codex 0.122+; older hook parsers ignore that unknown event while retaining the others.

| Hook event | Status transition | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | → `in-progress` | Marks startup/resume turns as active |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | → `in-progress` | User sent a message, agent starts working |
| `PreToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Agent is about to use Bash, apply a patch, or call an MCP tool |
| `PermissionRequest` | → `user-questions` | Codex is waiting for a tool or network approval |
| `PostToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Clears the waiting state after an approved tool finishes |
| `Stop` | → `review-by-ai` / `review-by-user` | One atomic server-side transition selects the correct review target and returns valid JSON to Codex |

Beyond status, the `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit` hook payloads carry the Codex `session_id` (the resumable rollout id), and the hook process inherits `$TMUX_PANE`. dev3 records that id onto the matching `sessionState` pane so recovery can `codex resume <id>` the exact per-pane session — Codex has no launch-time session-id flag, so this is the only way to target a specific session (see decision 125).

## Windows: how generated commands are spelled

Hook commands, the `!`-injected skill lines, and the Claude permission rule are
built from one platform dialect (`hookCliDialect` in `src/shared/dev3-cli-path.ts`).
POSIX output is frozen; Windows differs in three ways:

| Aspect | POSIX (macOS / Linux) | Windows |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| CLI invocation | `~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3` | absolute path to the bundled `dev3.exe` (`<exec dir>\cli\`, then `Resources\app\cli\`, then `%USERPROFILE%\.dev3.0\bin\`), double-quoted only if it contains spaces |
| App-offline tolerance in Claude hooks | `<cmd> \|\| [ $? -eq 2 ]` | `<cmd> --tolerate-app-offline` (no shell operators; the CLI exits 0 for that one condition) |
| Claude skill `!` injection | `… --if-status-not review-by-ai 2>&1` | same command without `2>&1` |

Codex hooks are identical in shape on both platforms — `dev3 hook codex` always
exits 0, so they never needed a shell fallback. See
[decision 172](decisions/2026/07/26/windows-hook-command-dialect.md).

## Skill Differences

### dev3 (task lifecycle)

The dev3 skill (`SKILL.md`) is installed into each agent's skill directory. Three variants exist:

- **Claude variant** — deliberately short: the full protocol body is already injected into the system prompt via `--append-system-prompt`, so `SKILL.md` only auto-sets the status and shows `dev3 current --brief` (via `!` command injection, zero tool calls). The full body is written to `PROTOCOL.md` next to it as a fallback for sessions started outside the dev3 launcher. See decision 114.
- **Codex variant** — full body; hook-aware status section with manual fallback for older sessions, keeps the `/bin/bash` shell note. The same body is also injected out-of-band as a developer message via `-c developer_instructions=...` on every dev3 launch, including scratch tasks and resume (decision 115); the skill file remains the fallback for sessions started outside the dev3 launcher
- **Generic variant** — full body (for Gemini it is the only protocol channel); full manual status management instructions ("CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE"), requires agents to run `dev3 task move` at start/end of every turn

All variants teach the same two-step dev3 bug-feedback flow: send the private anonymous vent first, then offer to create a public `h0x91b/dev-3.0` GitHub issue with the `Reported by AI` label after explicit user approval. They also treat an unqualified interactive artifact/report/dashboard request as a likely dev3 HTML artifact while preserving explicit Claude Artifact and build/package meanings. Each receives the same fixed six-file starter map, exact copy command, two-file edit boundary, and `dev3 show-artifact --assets` publish command.

### dev3-project-config (project configuration)

A supplementary skill that teaches agents about `.dev3/config.json` and `.dev3/config.local.json`. Covers the schema, merge priority, when to create/modify config files, and CLI commands (`dev3 config show`, `dev3 config export`). Same content for all agents (no variant differences).

### dev3-bug-hunter (displayed as "dev3 Bug Hunter")

A user-invocable skill that turns the agent into a seeded bug hunter. It generates a random seed, derives an identity letter, chooses a starting area plus analysis style, and then forces the hunt to begin from that assigned area before branching out. The skill is read-only, uses a terminal-friendly findings format with a compact ASCII summary table plus detail sections, asks whether `critical` and `medium` findings should become separate dev3 tasks, and requires those follow-up tasks to validate and reproduce the bug before any fix is attempted. When launched inside an existing task, it skips the main agent's session-start/lifecycle duties and may write only confirmed findings through `dev3 note add`. Same content for all agents.

For Gemini CLI specifically, dev-3.0 installs these managed skills only via the shared `~/.agents/skills/` alias. Gemini also discovers `~/.gemini/skills/`, but duplicating the same skill name in both user-scope directories triggers same-tier conflict warnings and the alias already has precedence.

## LLM provider (per-agent backend)

Each agent can run against its **native API** (default) or a registered
third-party backend (today: **Amazon Bedrock** for Claude), chosen via a
**per-agent** toggle inside that agent's row in **Settings → Coding Agents**
(`CodingAgent.llmProvider` / `CodingAgent.providerConfig`). dev3's built-in
configs select a model with `--model` using native aliases (e.g.
`claude-opus-4-8[1m]`); third-party providers reject those, so when one is
selected dev3 **omits `--model`** for that agent and injects the provider env
instead. Agents on their native provider — and agents with no registered
backend at all (Codex, Gemini, …, which show no toggle) — are unaffected.

Providers are data, not code: each one is a `ProviderDefinition` in the
`PROVIDER_REGISTRY` (`src/shared/llm-provider.ts`), keyed by an `LLM_PROVIDER` id
(`src/shared/types.ts`) and bound to an agent via its `agentCommand`. Adding a
backend = one id + one registry entry + i18n labels; the toggle, env injection,
and model table all read the registry. The toggle only appears on agents that
have ≥1 registered backend.

dev3 injects only the provider's enable flag + the pinned model (merged into the
launch env; a config's own `envVars` still win). **Credentials, AWS
region/profile are NOT set by dev3** — the customer configures those in their own
global agent setup (shell env / `~/.claude/settings.json`).

| Provider | Injected env | Model id source |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Anthropic | _(none)_ | `--model <alias>` as usual |
| Bedrock | `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | alias→`<geo>.anthropic.*` map (geo = `global`/`us`/`eu`/`apac` toggle), or the per-model override |

Known model aliases map to provider-native ids automatically
(`src/shared/llm-provider.ts`); unknown/new models are derived from the alias so
dev3 **always pins the model** (the agent never falls back to a different default
than dev3 expects). The settings model-mapping table is pre-populated and
inline-editable per model (Manual badge + Revert); a geo-aware provider's geo
toggle re-prefixes all non-overridden rows. See [decision 089](decisions/2026/07/06/llm-provider-toggle.md).

## Additional Integrations

| Integration | Agents | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` | All (fallback) | Appended rule block for agents that read `AGENTS.md` |
| `~/.agents/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml` | Shared skill UI | Managed display metadata for `dev3`, `dev3-project-config`, and `dev3 Bug Hunter` |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code | Auto-adds a `Bash(<dev3 cli> *)` permission — `Bash(~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 *)` on POSIX, `Bash(<abs path>\dev3.exe *)` on Windows |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | Codex | Configures trust, creates a fallback `permissions.workspace` default when missing, patches dev3 sandbox access, and enables the Codex hook feature with version-compatible key names. Paths are written as escaped TOML basic strings with native separators, and a config an earlier dev3 made unparsable on Windows is repaired in place on next launch (original copied to `config.toml.dev3-backup`) |
| `<worktree>/.codex/hooks.json` | Codex | Generated, gitignored lifecycle definitions mirrored into each dev3-launched Codex pane as session flags |
